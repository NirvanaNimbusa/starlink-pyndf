*  Name:
*     ONE_WORDEXP_FILE

*  Purpose:
*     WORDEXP wrapper that verifies a file exists

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C, intended to be called from Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ONE_WORDEXP_FILE( WORDS, CONTEXT, EXPAN, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     A wrapper around PSX_WORDEXP that only returns files that
*     match the supplied WORDS string following expansion. EXPAN
*     will be an empty string if there are no matches and CONECT
*     will be set to 0.

*  Notes:
*     - Continue to call this routine until CONTEXT is set to 0, otherwise
*     there will be a possible memory leak.
*     - If there are multiple returns from PSX_WORDEXP that are not files
*     this routine will loop internally until a valid file is located.

*  Arguments:
*     WORDS = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The string to be shell expanded.
*     CONTEXT = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Should be initialised to 0 for initial shell expansion. Will
*        be set to zero when no more results are available.
*     EXPAN = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Expanded string. A new string will be returned each call until
*        all are returned an CONTEXT is set to 0.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        The global status.

*        First version
*     2011-03-08 (TIMJ):
*        Continue looking for files if CONTEXT indicates that
*        there are more files to test and we have not yet found
*        a valid one.
