      LOGICAL FUNCTION NUM_WASOK()
*+
*  Name:
*     NUM_WASOK

*  Purpose:
*     Check current numeric error status

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     ISOK = NUM_WASOK()

*  Description:
*     Determine whether a numeric operation completed successfully.

*  Returned Value:
*     NUM_WASOK = LOGICAL
*        Returns TRUE if the numeric operation completed successfully.

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given & Returned)
*        Current error status from NUM subsystem. It is not modified
*        if STATUS is not SAI__OK on entry.
