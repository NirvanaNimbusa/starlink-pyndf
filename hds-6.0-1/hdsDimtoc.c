*  Name:
*    hdsDimtoc

*  Purpose:
*     Encode an hdsdim value as a string.

*  Synopsis:
*     void hdsDimtoc( hdsdim ivalue, char *string, size_t string_length,
*                     size_t *nchar )

*  Description:
*     Encode an hdsdim value as a (decimal) character string, using as
*     concise a format as possible, and return the number of characters
*     used. In the event of an error, "*'s will be written into to the
*     string. This is modelled on the "chrXtoc" functions in the CHR
*     library.

*  Parameters:
*     ivalue
*        The value to be encoded.
*     string
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the string into which the integer value is encoded.
*     string_length
*        The maximum length of the supplied 'string' array. This should
*        include room for the terminating null.
*     *nchar
*        Returned holding the field width used in encoding the value.
