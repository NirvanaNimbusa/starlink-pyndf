This is the HDS testsuite as obtained from RFWS.
This contains a FORTRAN program 'exercise.f', a series of '_input' files to 
be fed to this program and reference outputs (the _output files) obtained 
from running these tests on an unknown system (Solaris?).

Note that, when run on Linux, I had to slightly edit 'exercise.f' to remove
the "CARRIAGECONTROL=LIST" qualifiers on the file OPENs. More importantly
the fine detail of the "reference output" (spacing, blanks etc.) is machine
dependent. I found it more valuable to create a statically linked version
of exercise.f (exerciseo) linked against HDS Version 3 and another (exercise)
similarly linked against HDS Version 4. The simple script (loop-test.csh)
runs all the tests and generates differences if there is any regression.
