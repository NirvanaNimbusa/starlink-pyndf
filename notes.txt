According to its component.xml, HDS depends on sae, chr, cnf, ems and
starmem to build, and links to chr, cnf, ems and starmem.

We aren't going to build the fortran bindings, so we don't need: chr
(F77 character handling improvments).

HDS-v4 itself can be pulled in as a submodule, but sae, cnf, ems and
starmem will be copied from a current Starlink checkout (note that
these are not updated very often.)


SAE: (minor development include files etc.) does not depend on anything to buil.

CNF: used for writing code that can be C or F77 -- it feels like we shouldn't need this, but we do?

EMS: error message service, no new requirements (cnf, sae and starmem)

STARMEM: C memory management wrapper routines, no dependencies.
