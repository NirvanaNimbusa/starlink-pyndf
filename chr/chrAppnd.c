*  Name:
*     chrAppnd

*  Purpose:
*     Copy one string into another, ignoring trailing blanks.

*  Synopsis:
*     void chrAppnd( const char *str1, char *str2, size_t str2_length,
*                    size_t *iposn )

*  Description:
*     The string "str1" (or as much of it as there is room for) is copied
*     into the part of "str2" beginning at position "iposn". "iposn" is
*     updated to indicate the final length of "str2" after this operation.
*     Trailing blanks in "str1" are ignored.

*  Parameters:
*     str1
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be
*        copied.
*     str2
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be
*        updated.
*     str2_length
*        The maximum length of the 'str2' string. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *iposn
*        The used length of the "str2". If "str2" is empty on entry, then
*        this should be supplied as zero. On exit, the supplied value
*        is incremented by the length of "str1" (ignoring any trailing
*        spaces).

*  Notes:
*     If the output string is too small to append the entire input
*     string, truncation will occur and "iposn" will be set to the total
*     length of "str2" (excluding the trailing null).
