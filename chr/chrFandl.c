*  Name:
*     chrFandl

*  Purpose:
*     Find the first and last non-blank characters in a string.

*  Synopsis:
*     void chrFandl( const char *string, size_t *index1, size_t *index2 )

*  Description:
*     Find the indices of the first and last non-blank characters in the
*     given string. If the string contains no non-blank characters, the first
*     index is returned set to 1 and last index is returned set to 0, i.e.
*     "index1" is greater than "index2".

*  Parameters:
*     string
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the character string.
*     *index1
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of first non-blank character.
*     *index2
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of last non-blank character.

*  Notes:
*     - For consistency with the Fortran routine CHR_FANDL, this function
*     only checks for spaces. Other forms of whitespace characters such
*     as tabs, line-feeds, etc are considered to be non-blank.
