void chrPutc( const char *str1, char *str2, size_t str2_length, size_t *iposn ){

*  Name:
*     chrPutc

*  Purpose:
*     Put a character string into another at a given position.

*  Synopsis:
*     void chrPutc( const char *str1, char *str2, size_t str2_length,
*                   size_t *iposn )

*  Description:
*     The string "str1" (or as much of it as there is room for) is copied
*     into the part of "str2" beginning at position "iposn+1". "iposn" is
*     updated to indicate the end position of the copy of "str1" within
*     "str2" after this operation. If no copying is done, "iposn" is
*     returned unchanged.

*  Parameters:
*     str1
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be
*        copied.
*     str2
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string into which
*        "str1" is to be copied.
*     str2_length
*        The declared length of the supplied 'str2' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *iposn
*        The zero-based position pointer within "str2".
