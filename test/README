This is the directory of tests.

I'm still too new to Python to work out how to run the unit tests
*before* the module is installed (seems like the right thing to do and
it surprises me that setup.py doesn't have a "tests" target). Tests
fail in the parent directory currently because Python seems to load
the modules from the source tree rather than the build tree so the
_ndf.so part of the library will not load. The workaround is to cd
into this test directory after installing and run:

  python3.2 -m unittest discover
