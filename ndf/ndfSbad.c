void ndfSbad_( int bad, int indf, const char *comp, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfSbad

*  Purpose:
*     Set the bad-pixel flag for an NDF array component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSbad( int bad, int indf, const char *comp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets the value of the bad-pixel flag for an NDF array
*     component. A call to this function with "bad" set to non-zero
*     declares that the specified component may contain bad pixel values
*     for which checks must be made by algorithms which subsequently
*     process its values. A call with "bad" set to zero declares that there
*     are definitely no bad values present and that subsequent checks for
*     such values may be omitted.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Bad-pixel flag value to be set.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component; "DATA" or "VARIANCE".
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the bad-pixel flag will be set to the same value for each
*     component in turn.
*     -  If a component is mapped for access when this function is called,
*     then the bad-pixel flag will be associated with the mapped values.
*     This information will only be transferred to the actual data object
*     when the component is unmapped (but only if it was mapped for UPDATE
*     or WRITE access). The value transferred may be modified if conversion
*     errors occur during the unmapping process.
*     -  This function has no effect on components which are in an
*     undefined state; the bad-pixel flag for such components always
*     remains set to non-zero (or zero in the case of the QUALITY
*     component).
