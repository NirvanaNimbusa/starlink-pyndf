*  Name:
*     ndfSctyp

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the numeric type of a scaled NDF array component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSctyp( int indf, const char *comp, char *type,
*                    size_t type_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the numeric type of a scaled NDF array
*     component as an upper-case character string (e.g. "_REAL"). The
*     returned type describes the values stored in the array, before they
*     are unscaled using the associated scale and zero values. Use ndfType
*     if you need the data type of the array after it has been unscaled.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component whose type is required: "DATA" or "VARIANCE".
*     type
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the numeric type of the component.
*     type_length
*        The length of the supplied 'type' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the array is not stored in SCALED form, then this function
*     returns the same type as the "aryType" function.
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied to
*     this function. In this case the result returned will be the lowest
*     precision numeric type to which all the specified components can be
*     converted without unnecessary loss of information.
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__SZTYP may be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable which is to hold the numeric type of
*     an NDF array component. This constant is defined in the include file
*     "ndf.h".
