*  Name:
*     ndfLocked

*  Purpose:
*     Return information about any lock on an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     result = ndfLocked( int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This functions returns information about any lock on the base NDF
*     associated with the supplied NDF identifier. NDFs are locked and
*     unlocked using functions ndfLock and ndfUnlock.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     0 - the base NDF is unlocked
*     1 - the base NDF is locked by the current thread
*    -1 - the base NDF is locked by some other thread

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
