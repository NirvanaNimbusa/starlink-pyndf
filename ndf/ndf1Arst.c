void ndf1Arst( NdfACB *acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Arst

*  Purpose:
*     Reset an NDF's axis component to an undefined state.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Arst( NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function resets an NDF's axis coordinate system to an undefined
*     state by erasing the AXIS component in the data object (along with
*     all its sub-components).  All necessary cleaning up operations are
*     performed.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  An axis component cannot be reset while mapped access to any of
*     its arrays (or any part of them) is in effect. An error will rssult
*     if this is the case.
*     -  An axis component can only be reset via a base NDF. If the NDF
*     supplied is a section, then this function will return without action.
*     No error will result.
