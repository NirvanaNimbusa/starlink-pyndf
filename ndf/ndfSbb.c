void ndfSbb_( unsigned char badbit, int indf, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfSbb

*  Purpose:
*     Set a bad-bits mask value for the quality component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSbb( unsigned char badbit, int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function assigns a new unsigned byte bad-bits mask value to the
*     quality component of an NDF.

*  Notes:
*     -  If WRITE access to the NDF is not available, or if an NDF section
*     is supplied (as opposed to a base NDF), then no permanent change to
*     the data object will be made. In this case, the new bad-bits value
*     will be associated with the NDF identifier and will subsequently be
*     used by other NDF_ functions which access the NDF through this
*     identifier. The new value will also be propagated to any new
*     identifiers derived from it.

*  Parameters:
*     badbit
*        The unsigned byte bad-bits mask value.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.
