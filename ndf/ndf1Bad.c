void ndf1Bad( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int check, int *bad, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Bad

*  Purpose:
*     Determine if an array component of an ACB entry may contain bad
*     pixels.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Bad( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int check, int *bad,
*                   int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a logical value indicating whether an array
*     component of an NDF may contain bad pixels for which checks must be
*     made when the array's values are processed. Only if the returned
*     value is zero can such checks be omitted. If the "check" parameter to
*     this function is set non-zero, then it will also perform an explicit
*     check (if necessary) to see whether bad pixels are actually present.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component; "DATA", "QUALITY" or "VARIANCE".
*     check
*        Whether to perform an explicit check to see whether bad pixels are
*        actually present.
*     *bad
*        Returned holding the whether it is necessary to check for bad
*        pixels when processing the array's values.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the function returns the logical "OR" of the results for
*     each component.
*     -  If "check" is set zero, then the returned value of "bad" will
*     indicate whether bad pixels might be present and should therefore be
*     checked for during subsequent processing. However, even if "bad" is
*     returned non-zero in such circumstances, it is still possible that
*     there may not actually be any bad pixels present (for instance, in an
*     NDF section, the region of the array accessed might happen to avoid
*     all the bad pixels).
*     -  If "check" is set non-zero, then an explicit check will be made,
*     if necessary, to ensure that "bad" is only returned non-zero if bad
*     pixels are actually present in the data.
*     -  A non-zero result will be returned for any components whose value
*     is undefined, except in the case of the QUALITY component, for which
*     a zero result is always returned in these circumstances.
*     -  If a component is mapped for access, then the value of "bad" will
*     refer to the actual mapped values. It may differ from its original
*     (unmapped) value if conversion errors occurred during the mapping
*     process or if an initialisation option of "/ZERO" was specified for a
*     component whose value was initially undefined.
