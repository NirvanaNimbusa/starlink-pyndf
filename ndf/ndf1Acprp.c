*  Name:
*     ndf1Acprp

*  Purpose:
*     Propagate axis character information from one NDF to another.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Acprp( NdfACB *acb1, int iccomp, int accpf, NdfDCB *dcb2,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function propagates axis character information from an existing
*     NDF to a new one which is being created. Propagation is controlled by
*     a logical flag.

*  Parameters:
*     acb1
*        Pointer to the input NDF entry in the ACB.
*     iccomp
*        The axis character component to be propagated (one of the symbolic
*        values NDF__ALAB or NDF__AUNI, as defined in the include file
*        "ndf1.h").
*     accpf
*        Whether the component is to be propagated. The function takes no
*        action if this value is zero.
*     dcb2
*        Pointer to the output NDF entry in the DCB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     -  If axis character information is being propagated, then the output
*     NDF should contain an axis structure to receive this information.
*     Axis character information should not be present in this output axis
*     structure beforehand.
