*  Name:
*     ndfBb

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the bad-bits mask value for the quality component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfBb( int indf, unsigned char *badbit, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an unsigned byte value representing the bad-
*     bits mask associated with the quality component of an NDF.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *badbit
*        Returned holding the unsigned byte bad-bits mask.
*     *status
*        The global status.
