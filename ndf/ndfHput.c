*  Name:
*     ndfHput

*  Purpose:
*     Write history information to an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHput( const char *hmode, const char *appn, int repl,
*                   int nlines, char *const text[], int trans, int wrap,
*                   int rjust, int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes textual information to the history component of
*     an NDF, creating a new history record if necessary. A variety of
*     formatting options are available and values may be substituted for
*     message tokens embedded within the text. The text supplied may either
*     augment or replace the history information normally written by
*     default.

*  Parameters:
*     hmode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the priority for the
*        text being written: "VERBOSE", "NORMAL" or "QUIET", where
*        "VERBOSE" signifies the lowest priority and "QUIET" signifies the
*        highest.  The value given may be abbreviated, to no less then
*        three characters. A blank value is accepted as a synonym for
*        "NORMAL".
*     appn
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        current application. This will only be used if a new history
*        record is created by this function, otherwise it is ignored. If a
*        blank value is given, then a system-supplied default will be used
*        instead. If the special value "<APPEND>" is supplied, then the
*        text is always appended to the current history record, even if it
*        was created by a previous application.
*     repl
*        Whether the text supplied is intended to replace the history
*        information which is supplied by default. If a non-zero value is
*        given and no default history information has yet been written to
*        the NDF, then subsequent writing of this information will be
*        suppressed. If a zero value is given, then default history
*        information is not suppressed and will later be appended to the
*        text supplied (unless suppressed by another call to ndfHput). The
*        supplied value is ignored, and a value of non-zero assumed, if
*        "appn" is supplied equal to "<APPEND>".
*     nlines
*        Number of lines of history text supplied in array "text".
*     text
*        Pointer to an array in which each element is a pointer to a null
*        terminated string holding a line of history text to be written.
*        The length of this array is given by "nlines". The length of each
*        string should not exceed the value NDF__SZHMX. The recommended
*        length of each string is given by the constant NDF__SZHIS. (Both
*        of these constants are defined in the include file "ndf.h".)
*     trans
*        If a non-zero value is supplied, then any message tokens embedded
*        in the supplied text will be expanded before it is written to the
*        history record (see SUN/104 for a description of how to use
*        message tokens). If a zero value is given, then the supplied text
*        is taken literally; no special characters will be recognised and
*        no message token expansion will occur.
*     wrap
*        If a non-zero value is given, then paragraph wrapping will be
*        performed on the supplied text (after message token expansion if
*        appropriate) so as to make as much text fit on to each line of a
*        history record as possible. Blank input lines may be used to
*        delimit paragraphs. If a zero value is given, then input lines
*        which exceed the history record's text width will simply be broken
*        (at a space if possible) and continued on a new line.
*     rjust
*        If a non-zero value is given, then lines of history text will be
*        padded out with blanks (after message token expansion and
*        paragraph wrapping if appropriate) so as to give a justified right
*        margin. If a zero value is given, then the right margin will
*        remain ragged.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function will return without action if (a) there is no
*     history component present in the NDF, (b) the priority specified via
*     "hmode" is lower than the NDF's current history update mode setting,
*     or (c) the NDF's history update mode is currently set to "DISABLED".
*     -  It is expected that the "appn" parameter will usually be left
*     blank. A non-blank value should normally only be given for this
*     parameter if a more complete identification of the current
*     application can be given than is supplied by default.
*     -  If no previous history information has been written to the NDF by
*     the current application, then this function will create a new history
*     record whose text width will be determined by the maximum length of
*     the lines of the "text" array. If history information has already been
*     written, then this function will append to the existing history record.
*     In this case, the text width will already have been defined, so the
*     supplied text will be re-formatted if necessary (by line breaking or
*     paragraph wrapping) to fit into the available width.
*     -  Paragraph wrapping is recommended, when appropriate, as a means of
*     saving space while retaining a neat appearance in the resulting
*     history record. It is particularly useful when message tokens are
*     used within normal text, since these make it hard to predict the
*     precise length of history lines in advance.  The right justification
*     flag may be used to improve the cosmetic appearance of history text,
*     but it has no effect on the amount of space used.
*     -  On exit from this function, all message tokens in the current
*     message context are left in an undefined state.
