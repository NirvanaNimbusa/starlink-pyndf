*  Name:
*     ndf1Cuserid

*  Purpose:
*     Get the username

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cuserid( char *user, size_t user_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function gets a username associated with the effective
*     user ID of the current process. If the username cannot be found,
*     a blank string is returned.

*  Arguments:
*     user
*        A buffer in which to return the null-terminated user name.
*     user_length
*        The length of the buffer, including roiom for a terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  On a Unix system the translation from effective user ID to
*        username is performed. Since there can be several usernames
*        associated with a user ID, there is no guarantee that the value
*        returned will be unique.
*     -  The Unix function cuserid is no longer in the IEEE 1003.1-1990
*        standard, so an alternative to this routine is used if available.
*        with getpwuid being preferred over getlogin over cuserid.
*     -  If the system call can not obtain a user ID, the value of LOGNAME
*        environment variable is returned as a last resort. And if that is
*        not there we use $USER. Only relevant currently if getenv() function
*        exists.
*     -  If the first attempt to get the username fails, one more attempt
*        is made. This overcomes an occasional (timing?) problem on Linux.
*
*     -  Under MinGW (Windows) the GetUserName function is used.
