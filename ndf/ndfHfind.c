*  Name:
*     ndfHfind

*  Purpose:
*     Find an NDF history record by date and time.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHfind( int indf, const int ymdhm[], float sec, int eq,
*                    int *irec, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function searches the history component of an NDF to identify
*     the first history record which was written after a specified date and
*     time. The record number is returned. A value of zero is returned if
*     no suitable record exists.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     ymdhm
*        The year, month, day, hour and minute fields of the required date
*        and time, in that order, stored as integers (the month field
*        starts at 1 for January). The supplied "ymdhm" array should have
*        at least "5" elements.
*     sec
*        The seconds field of the required date and time.
*     eq
*        If a non-zero value is given for this parameter, then a history
*        record whose date and time exactly matches that specified may be
*        returned. Otherwise, the record must have been written strictly
*        later than specified.
*     *irec
*        Returned holding the record number of the required history record,
*        or zero if no suitable record exists.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The last history record written before a specified date and time may
*     be found by subtracting 1 from the record number returned by this
*     function (or using the final record if this function returns zero).
