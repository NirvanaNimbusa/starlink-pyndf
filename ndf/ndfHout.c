*  Name:
*     ndfHout

*  Purpose:
*     Display text from an NDF history record.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHout( int indf, int irec,
*                   void ( *routin )( int, char *const [], int * ),
*                   int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function displays the text associated with a specified NDF
*     history record by invoking a service function suppled by the caller.
*     A standard service function ndfHecho is provided, but this may be
*     replaced if required.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     irec
*        One-based number of the NDF history record whose text is to be
*        displayed.
*     routin
*        A service function to which the text will be passed for display.
*        For a specification of this function, see the default function
*        ndfHecho.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*     8-OCT-2019 (DSB):
*        Use astMalloc rather than astStore to allocate storage for the
*        null-terminated copy of each fixed length string. This is to
*        avoid reading one character beyond the end of the fixed-length
*        array (doing so has been seen to cause a seg fault).
