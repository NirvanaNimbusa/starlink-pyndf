*  Name:
*     ndfMtype

*  Purpose:
*     Match the types of the array components of a pair of NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMtype( const char *typlst, int indf1, int indf2,
*                    const char *comp, char *itype, size_t itype_length,
*                    char *dtype, size_t dtype_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function matches the types of the array components of a pair of
*     NDFs, selecting a numeric type which an application may use to
*     process these components. It also returns the type which should be
*     used for storing the result of this processing.

*  Parameters:
*     typlst
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding A comma-separated list
*        of the numeric types which the application can process explicitly;
*        e.g. "_INTEGER,_REAL". The first type which has sufficient
*        precision will be selected from this list, so they should normally
*        be given in order of increasing computational cost.
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the first NDF whose type is to be matched.
*     indf2
*        Identifier for the second NDF.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component whose type is to be considered.
*     itype
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the numeric type which the application should use to
*        process the NDF components. This value is returned as an upper
*        case character string of maximum length NDF__SZTYP. Its value is
*        the first entry in the "typlst" list to which the NDF array
*        components may be converted without unnecessary loss of
*        information.
*     itype_length
*        The length of the supplied 'itype' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     dtype
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the data type required to hold the result of processing
*        the NDF array components. This result is returned as an upper case
*        character string of maximum length NDF__SZFTP. It is intended to
*        be used as input to the ndfStype function to set the type of the
*        output NDF component into which the result will be written.
*     dtype_length
*        The length of the supplied 'dtype' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the results returned by this function will take account of
*     the types of all the specified components in both NDFs.
*     -  Matching of the type of a single NDF to an application may be
*     performed by supplying the same identifier value for both the "indf1"
*     and "indf2" arguments. There is no extra cost in doing this.
*     -  If the "typlst" parameter does not specify any type to which the
*     NDF components may be converted without loss of information, then the
*     function will return the highest precision type which is available.
*     An error will be reported, however, and "status" will be set to
*     NDF__TYPNI (type not implemented).
*     -  The constants NDF__SZTYP and NDF__SZFTP are defined in the include
*     file "ndf.h". The error code NDF__TYPNI is defined in the include
*     file "ndf_err.h".
