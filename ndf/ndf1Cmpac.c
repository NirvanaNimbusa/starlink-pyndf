void ndf1Cmpac( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *comp, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Cmpac

*  Purpose:
*     Check for an error accessing a compressed array

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cmpac( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *comp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function check to see if an error has occurred whilst accessing
*     a compressed (and therefore read-only) array component of an NDF. If
*     such an error has been reported by the ARY system, then the error is
*     annulled and re-reported using more NDF-centric message.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the DCB.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the array component
*        name; "DATA", "QUALITY" or "VARIANCE" (or "ERROR") (case
*        insensitive). The name should not include any white space.
*     *status
*        The global status.
