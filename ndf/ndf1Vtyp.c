*  Name:
*     ndf1Vtyp

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the numeric data type of the variance component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Vtyp( NdfACB *acb, char *type, size_t type_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the numeric data type of the variance component
*     of an NDF identified by its index in the ACB. The data type is
*     returned as an upper case character string.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry identifying the NDF.
*     type
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the numeric data type.
*     type_length
*        The length of the supplied 'type' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.
