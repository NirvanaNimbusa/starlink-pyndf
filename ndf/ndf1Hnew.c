void ndf1Hnew( HDSLoc *loc1, const char *name, const char *type, int ndim,

/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Hnew

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new HDS object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hnew( HDSLoc *loc1, const char *name, const char *type,
*                    int ndim, const hdsdim dim[], HDSLoc **loc2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new HDS object. It performs a similar task to
*     the HDS function "datNew", except that it will accept a compound
*     component name consisting of a sequence of component names separated
*     by "." (array slice/cell subscripts may also be included). A complete
*     object specification including a container file name may also be
*     given if the input locator supplied is set to NULL. All
*     components which appear in the "name" parameter except for the last
*     one must already exist.  The object to be created must not itself
*     exist.  If successful, the function returns a locator to the new
*     object. This will be a primary locator if a new container file was
*     opened or created (i.e. if "loc1" was set to NULL), otherwise it
*     will be a secondary locator.

*  Parameters:
*     loc1
*        Locator to an existing HDS structure (or NULL if the "name"
*        parameter contains a complete object specification).
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the relative HDS path
*        name of the object to be created.
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the HDS object type.
*     ndim
*        Number of object dimensions.
*     dim
*        Object dimensions.
*     *loc2
*        Returned holding the locator to the new object.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If this function is called with "status" set, then a NULL locator
*     will be returned via the "loc2" parameter. The same value will also
*     be returned if the function should fail for any reason.
