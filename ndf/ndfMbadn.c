*  Name:
*     ndfMbadn

*  Purpose:
*     Merge the bad-pixel flags of the array components of a number of
*     NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMbadn( int badok, int n, const int ndfs[], const char *comp,
*                    int check, int *bad, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function merges the bad-pixel flag values of an array component
*     (or components) for a number of NDFs, returning the logical "OR" of
*     the separate values for each NDF. In addition, if bad pixels are
*     found to be present in any NDF but the application indicates that it
*     cannot correctly handle such values, then an error to this effect is
*     reported and a "status" value is set.

*  Parameters:
*     badok
*        Whether the application can correctly handle NDF array components
*        containing bad pixel values.
*     n
*        Number of NDFs whose bad-pixel flags are to be merged.
*     ndfs
*        Array of identifiers for the NDFs to be merged. The supplied
*        "ndfs" array should have at least "n" elements.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component: "DATA", "QUALITY" or "VARIANCE".
*     check
*        Whether to perform explicit checks to see whether bad pixels are
*        actually present. (This parameter performs the same function as in
*        the function ndfBad.)
*     *bad
*        Returned holding the combined bad-pixel flag value (the logical
*        "OR" of the values obtained for each NDF).
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the function will take the logical "OR" of all the
*     specified components when calculating the combined bad-pixel flag
*     value.
*     -  The effective value of the bad-pixel flag for each NDF array
*     component which this function uses is the same as would be returned
*     by a call to the function ndfBad.
*     -  If this function detects the presence of bad pixels which the
*     application cannot support (as indicated by a zero value for the
*     "badok" parameter), then an error will be reported to this effect and
*     a "status" value of NDF__BADNS (bad pixels not supported) will be
*     returned.  The value of the "bad" parameter will be set to non-zero
*     under these circumstances. The NDF__BADNS constant is defined in the
*     header file "ndf_err.h".
