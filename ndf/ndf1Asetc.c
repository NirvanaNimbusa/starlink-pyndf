*  Name:
*     ndf1Asetc

*  Purpose:
*     Set an AST_ character attribute value.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Asetc( AstFrameSet *iast, const char *value,
*                     const char *attrib, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function calls "astSetC" to assign a character attribute value
*     to an AST_ Object. It is a simple wrap-up of this AST_ function with
*     the character parameter order swapped. This is done so that mapped
*     character data may be used for the attribute value.

*  Parameters:
*     iast
*        Pointer to the AST_ Object.
*     value
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the attribute vakue to
*        be assigned.
*     attrib
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the attribute name.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - Trailing blanks are removed from the attribute value before use.
