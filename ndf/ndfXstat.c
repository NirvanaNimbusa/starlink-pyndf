*  Name:
*     ndfXstat

*  Purpose:
*     Determine if a named NDF extension exists.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXstat( int indf, const char *xname, hdsbool_t *there,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a logical value indicating whether a named
*     extension is present in an NDF.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        extension.
*     *there
*        Returned holding the whether the extension is present in the NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.
