*  Name:
*     ndf1Mtyp

*  Purpose:
*     Match the data type of an array component of a sequence of NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Mtyp( const char *typlst, int n, const int ndfs[],
*                    const char *comp, char *itype, size_t itype_length,
*                    char *dtype, size_t dtype_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function determines the numeric data type of the specified array
*     components of a series of NDFs and checks a comma-separated list of
*     the numeric types supported explicitly by an application, returning
*     the first type from this list which can be used to process the data
*     without loss of information. If no suitable type appears in the list,
*     then an error is reported to this effect. The function also returns
*     the "maximised" numeric type (i.e. the lowest precision type to which
*     all the NDFs may be converted without losing information).

*  Parameters:
*     typlst
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding a comma-separated list
*        of the numeric types supported by an application (normally in
*        increasing order of computational cost).
*     n
*        The number of NDFs whose numeric data types are to be matched.
*     ndfs
*        Identifiers for the NDFs to be matched. The supplied "ndfs" array
*        should have at least "n" elements.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component whose type is to be considered.
*     itype
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the numeric data type (selected from the "typlst"
*        parameter) to which the NDF components should be converted for
*        processing by the application. This value is returned as an upper
*        case character string of maximum length NDF__SZTYP.
*     itype_length
*        The length of the supplied 'itype' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     dtype
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the lowest precision numeric data type to which all the
*        specified NDF components may be converted without loss of
*        information. This value is returned as an upper case character
*        string of maximum length NDF__SZFTP.
*     dtype_length
*        The length of the supplied 'dtype' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be given, in
*     which case all the specified NDF components will be considered when
*     calculating the "maximised" data type.
*     -  If insufficient precision is available using any of the data types
*     specified in "typlst", then "itype" will return the data type with
*     the highest precision in this list as the "best compromise" result.
*     An error will result, however, and a "status" value of NDF__TYPNI
*     (type not implemented) will be returned. This error may simply be
*     annulled if the "best compromise" result is to be used.
*     -  The value of "dtype" returned by this function is intended as
*     input to the ndfStype function, to set the data type of an
*     application's output NDF appropriately to hold the result without
*     loss of information.
