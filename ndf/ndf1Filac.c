*  Name:
*     ndf1Filac

*  Purpose:
*     Check if a specified mode of access is available for a file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Filac( const char *fname, const char *mode, int report, int *ok,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks whether a specified mode of access is available
*     for a named file and returns a logical result. If access is not
*     available, the routine will also (optionally) set "status" and make
*     an appropriate error report.

*  Arguments:
*     fname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the file.
*     mode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the required mode of
*        access: 'READ', 'UPDATE' or 'WRITE' (case insensitive). The
*        value 'EXISTS' may also be supplied, in which case a check is
*        made that the file exists but no check is made on the access
*        available to the file.
*     report
*        Whether to set "status" and make an error report if the requested
*        mode of access is not available.
*     *ok
*        Returned holding a flag indicating if the requested mode of access
*        was available.
*     *status
*        The global status.
