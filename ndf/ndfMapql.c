void ndfMapql_( int indf, int **pntr, size_t *el, int *bad, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfMapql

*  Purpose:
*     Map the quality component of an NDF as an array of logical values.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMapql( int indf, int **pntr, size_t *el, int *bad, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function maps the quality component of an NDF for read access,
*     returning a pointer to an array of logical values. Elements of this
*     array are set to non-zero if the bit-wise "AND" of the corresponding
*     quality value and its effective bad-bits mask gives a zero result,
*     indicating that the corresponding NDF pixel may be used in subsequent
*     processing. Other array elements are set to zero, indicating that
*     corresponding NDF pixels should be excluded from subsequent
*     processing.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *pntr
*        Returned holding the pointer to the mapped array of logical
*        values.
*     *el
*        Returned holding the number of values mapped.
*     *bad
*        Returned holding the this parameter is set to non-zero if any of
*        the mapped values is set to zero (i.e. if any NDF pixels are to be
*        excluded as a consequence of the associated quality values).
*        Otherwise it is set to zero.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the quality component's values are undefined, then this
*     function will return a pointer to an array of non-zero values.
*     -  Note that this function only obtains read access to the quality
*     component; changes made to the mapped values will not be reflected in
*     changes to the NDF's quality values.
*     -  This function disables automatic quality masking, so that
*     subsequent access to other NDF array components via the same
*     identifier will take no account of the possible presence of
*     associated quality values.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of 1
*     will be returned for the "el" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur.  The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
