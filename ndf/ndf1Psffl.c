*  Name:
*     ndf1Psffl

*  Purpose:
*     Parse a foreign format list.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Psffl( const char *list, int mxel, size_t ibeg[], size_t iend[],
*                     int *el, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function locates elements in a list of foreign data format
*     specifications held as a character string and returns the character
*     positions at which they start and end. All blanks surrounding each
*     list element are discarded, as also are blank elements themselves.
*     Checks are performed to ensure that the space available for storing
*     element positions is not exceeded.

*  Parameters:
*     list
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the foreign format
*        list which is to be split up.
*     mxel
*        The maximum number of list elements expected.
*     ibeg
*        Returned holding the array of zero-based character positions
*        identifying the start of each element in "list". The supplied "ibeg"
*        array should have at least "mxel" elements.
*     iend
*        Returned holding the array of zero-based character positions
*        identifying the end of each element in "list". The supplied "iend"
*        array should have at least "mxel" elements.
*     *el
*        Number of list elements returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.
