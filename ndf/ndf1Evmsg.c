void ndf1Evmsg( const char *token, NdfDCB *dcb ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Evmsg

*  Purpose:
*     Assign text describing a standard NDF event to a specified message
*     token.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Evmsg( const char *token, NdfDCB *dcb )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a string describing the supplied NDF that can
*     be used as the descriptive text associated with an NDF event (see
*     ndf1Event), and then assigns it to a specified message token.
*
*     The string contains the following fields, separated by double colons
*     ("::"):
*
*     - The NDF path
*     - The foreign format code (if any)
*
*     Any trailing blank fields are omitted, together with the associated
*     "::" delimiters.

*  Parameters:
*     token
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        message token to use.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB entry to be used.

*  Notes:
*     - This function has no STATUS parameter and does not perform normal
*     error checking. If it should fail, then no value will be assigned to
*     the message token and this will be apparent in the final message.
