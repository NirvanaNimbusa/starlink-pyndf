void ndf1LockACB( NdfACB *acb, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1LockACB

*  Purpose:
*     Lock an ACB for use by the current thread.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1LockACB( NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function attempts to lock the DCB associated with the
*     supplied ACB so it can be used only by the current thread. The ACB
*     should previously have been unlocked using ndf1UnlockACB - an error
*     is reported otherwise. If successfull, the context level stored in
*     the supplied ACB is set to the context level in the current thread
*     (each thread has its own context level stored in its thread-specific
*     data area).

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        The ACB to be locked.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if an error has already
*     occurred.
