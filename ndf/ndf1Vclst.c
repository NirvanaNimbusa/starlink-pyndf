*  Name:
*     ndf1Vclst

*  Purpose:
*     Validate a comma-separated list of NDF component names.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Vclst( const char *text, int ncomp, const char *cnames[],
*                     int cflags[], int *nset, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks each word in a supplied comma-separated
*     character string. If a word is a valid abbreviation for one of the
*     NDF components included in the supplied "cnames" array, then the
*     corresponding element in "cflags" is set non-zero on return. If a
*     word is "*" then all flags in the returned "cflags" array are set
*     non-zero If a word is anything else, an error is reported.

*  Parameters:
*     text
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the supplied comma-
*        separated list of words.
*     ncomp
*        The length of the "cnames" and "cflags" arrays.
*     cnames
*        Pointer to an array of pointers to null terminated strings. Each
*        element should holds the full upper case name of an acceptable
*        NDF component. The supplied "cnames" array should have at least
*        "ncomp" elements.
*     cflags
*        On exit, each element is set non-zero if and only if the NDF
*        component named in the corresponding element of "cnames" was
*        included in the list of components supplied via "text". The
*        supplied "cflags" array should have at least "ncomp" elements.
*     *nset
*        Returned holding the on exits, holds the number of non-zero values
*        in "cflags".
*     *status
*        The global status.
