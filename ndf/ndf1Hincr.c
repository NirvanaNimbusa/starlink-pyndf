void ndf1Hincr( NdfDCB *dcb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Hincr

*  Purpose:
*     Increment the history record for an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hincr( NdfDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function opens a new record in the history structure for an NDF,
*     ready to receive new history information. If the history record array
*     is not large enough to contain a new record, it is extended. The DCB
*     current history record count is incremented to identify the new
*     record. This function does not create any components within the new
*     record structure.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to a DCB entry identifying the NDF whose history is to be
*        incremented.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The history component which this function is to modify must exist
*     before the function is called, and DCB information must exist about
*     it. This function does not check for this itself.
