void ndf1Amsg( const char *token, NdfACB *acb ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Amsg

*  Purpose:
*     Assign the name of an NDF identified in the ACB to a message token.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Amsg( const char *token, NdfACB *acb )

*  Description:
*     This function assigns the full name (including the file name) of an
*     NDF to a message token for use with the ERR_ and MSG_ functions
*     (SUN/104). If an NDF section is supplied, then a dimension bound
*     expression is appended to the data object's name. The NDF is
*     identified by the index of its entry in the ACB.

*  Parameters:
*     token
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        message token.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function has no "status" parameter and does not perform
*     normal error checking. If it should fail, then no value will be
*     assigned to the message token and this will be apparent in the final
*     message.
