void ndf1Del( NdfACB **acb, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Del

*  Purpose:
*     Perform a deletion operation on an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Del( NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function performs a deletion operation on an entry in the ACB.
*     If the specified ACB entry describes a base NDF, then it and all
*     other ACB entries which refer to the same data object are annulled,
*     and the data object is erased.  If the ACB entry does not describe a
*     base NDF, then that ACB entry (alone) is annulled, and the data
*     object is not erased.

*  Parameters:
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry on which the deletion operation is to be
*        performed. A value of zero is returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.

*  Side Effects:
*     -   If a data object is erased, then all NDF identifiers which refer
*     to it become invalid.
