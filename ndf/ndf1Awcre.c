void ndf1Awcre( int iax, NdfDCB *dcb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Awcre

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that an NDF axis width array exists, creating one if
*     necessary.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Awcre( int iax, NdfDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that an axis width array exists for an NDF with
*     an entry in the DCB. If the data object does not currently have an
*     axis width array, then one is created.  An NDF axis coordinate system
*     is first created by this function if necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     iax
*        Zero-based axis index.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the data object entry in the DCB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Any width array created is left in an undefined state by this
*     function.
