void ndfMsg_( const char *token, int indf ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfMsg

*  Purpose:
*     Assign the name of an NDF to a message token.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMsg( const char *token, int indf )

*  Description:
*     This function assigns the name of an NDF to a message token (in a
*     form which a user will understand) for use in constructing messages
*     with the ERR_ and MSG_ functions (see SUN/104).

*  Parameters:
*     token
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        message token.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function has no STATUS parameter and performs no error
*     checking. If it should fail, then no assignment to the message token
*     will be made and this will be apparent in the final message.
