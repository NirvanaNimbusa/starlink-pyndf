*  Name:
*     ndf1Impid

*  Purpose:
*     Import an identifier.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Impid( int indf, NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function converts an NDF identifier, previously issued by
*     ndf1Expid, into a  pointer to an ACB. The identifier value is
*     fully checked and an error is reported if it is not valid.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *acb
*        Pointer to an entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.
