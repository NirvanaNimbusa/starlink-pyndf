void ndf1Avrst( int iax, NdfACB *acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Avrst

*  Purpose:
*     Reset an axis variance array to an undefined state.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Avrst( int iax, NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function resets an axis variance array to an undefined state by
*     deleting it if it already exists.

*  Parameters:
*     iax
*        Zero-based index of the NDF axis whose variance array is to be
*        reset.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  An axis variance array cannot be reset with this function while
*     mapped access to any part of it is in effect.
*     -  This function may only be used to reset an axis variance array for
*     a base NDF. It returns without action if the NDF supplied is a
*     section.
