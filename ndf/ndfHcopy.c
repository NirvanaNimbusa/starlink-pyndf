*  Name:
*     ndfHcopy

*  Purpose:
*     Copy history information from one NDF to another.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHcopy( int indf1, int indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies history information from one NDF to another,
*     replacing any that already exists in the destination NDF.

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the NDF (or NDF section) containing the history
*        information to be copied.
*     indf2
*        Identifier for the NDF to receive the copied history information.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This function returns without action leaving the destination NDF
*     unchanged if no History component exists in the input NDF.
*     - If the input NDF contains a History component, then a History
*     component is added to the destination NDF automatically, if one does
*     not already exist.
