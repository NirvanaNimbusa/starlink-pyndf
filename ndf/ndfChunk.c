void ndfChunk_( int indf1, int mxpix, int ichunk, int *indf2, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfChunk

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an NDF section containing a chunk of contiguous pixels.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfChunk( int indf1, int mxpix, int ichunk, int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an identifier for an NDF section describing a
*     "chunk" of contiguous pixels selected from an initial NDF.  The
*     function divides the initial NDF logically into a series of such
*     chunks, each of which follows immediately on from the previous chunk,
*     and each of which contains no more than a specified maximum number
*     ("mxpix") of contiguous pixels. The function's "ichunk" parameter
*     allows one of these chunks to be selected; an NDF section for it is
*     then returned.

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the initial NDF.
*     mxpix
*        Maximum number of contiguous pixels required in each chunk.
*     ichunk
*        Number of the chunk required (the first chunk is numbered 1).
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the identifier for an NDF section describing the
*        chunk.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is intended to allow large NDFs to be processed in
*     smaller pieces by selecting successive chunks, each of which may then
*     be processed individually. Note that in general not all the chunks
*     selected from an NDF will have the same size, although none will
*     contain more than the specified maximum number of pixels.
*     -  Corresponding chunks selected from different NDFs (or NDF
*     sections) with identical shapes will themselves have identical shapes
*     and will contain the same number of pixels.
*     -  All NDF sections obtained via this function have the same number
*     of dimensions as the input NDF.
*     -  If the number of the requested chunk ("ichunk") exceeds the number
*     of chunks available in the NDF, then a value of NDF__NOID will be
*     returned for the "indf2" parameter (but no error will result). This
*     condition may be used to terminate a loop when all available chunks
*     have been processed. The ndfNchnk function may also be used to
*     determine the number of chunks available.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason.
*     -  The NDF__NOID constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
