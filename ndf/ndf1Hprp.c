*  Name:
*     ndf1Hprp

*  Purpose:
*     Propagate history information from one NDF to another.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hprp( NdfDCB *dcb1, int prop, NdfDCB *dcb2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function propagates attributes and information from one NDF"s
*     history structure to a new one which is being created.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb1
*        Pointer to the input NDF.
*     prop
*        Whether history information is to be propagated.
*     dcb2
*        Pointer to the output NDF. This must not already contain a history
*        component (this function does not check for this).
*     *status
*        The global status.
