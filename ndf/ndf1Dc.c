void ndf1Dc( NdfDCB *dcb, int iccomp, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Dc

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that character component information is available in the DCB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Dc( NdfDCB *dcb, int iccomp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that information about the specified NDF
*     character component is available in the DCB. It does nothing if this
*     information is already available. Otherwise, it inspects the actual
*     data object to obtain this information and enters it into the DCB,
*     performing necessary validation checks in the process.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB entry for which information is required.
*     iccomp
*        Identifier for the character component for which information is
*        required; one of the symbolic constants NDF__LABEL, NDF__TITLE or
*        NDF__UNITS.
*     *status
*        The global status.
