char **ndf1Findwords( const char *text, int *el, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Findwords

*  Purpose:
*     Split a string into a list of comma-separated substrings.

*  Synopsis:
*     char **ndf1Findwords( const char *text, int *el, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function splits the supplied string up using commas as
*     delimiters, and returns the resulting substrings in an array, with
*     leading and trailing spaces removed.

*  Parameters:
*     text
*        The null terminated stext string to split.
*     *el
*        Returned holding the number of substrings returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Returned value:
*     Pointer to an array that has "*el" elements. Each element holds a
*     pointer to a null terminated string. The returned resources should
*     be freed using ndf1Freewords when no longer needed.

*  Notes:
*     -  NULL is returned if an error occurs.
