*  Name:
*     ndfSqmf

*  Purpose:
*     Set a new logical value for an NDF's quality masking flag.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSqmf( int qmf, int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets a new logical value for an NDF's quality masking
*     flag.  This flag determines whether the NDF's quality component (if
*     present) will be used to generate "bad" pixel values for automatic
*     insertion into the data and variance arrays when these are accessed
*     in READ or UPDATE mode. If this flag is set to non-zero, then masking
*     will occur, so that an application need not consider the quality
*     information explicitly.  If the flag is set to zero, then automatic
*     masking will not occur, so that the application can process the
*     quality component by accessing it directly.

*  Parameters:
*     qmf
*        The logical value to be set for the quality masking flag.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A quality masking flag is associated with each NDF identifier and
*     is initially set to non-zero.  Its value changes to zero whenever the
*     quality component is accessed directly (e.g. using ndfMap or
*     ndfMapql) and reverts to non-zero when access is relinquished (e.g.
*     using ndfUnmap). This default behaviour may also be over-ridden by
*     calling ndfSqmf to set its value explicitly. The function ndfQmf
*     allows the current value to be determined.
*     -  The value of the quality masking flag is not propagated to new
*     identifiers.
