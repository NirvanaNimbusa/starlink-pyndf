void ndf1Getap( char *appn, size_t appn_length, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Getap

*  Purpose:
*     Get the name of the currently-executing application.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Getap( char *appn, size_t appn_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the name of the currently-running application,
*     left justified. The returned value will be truncated without error if
*     the variable supplied is too short.

*  Parameters:
*     appn
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding application name.
*     appn_length
*        The length of the supplied 'appn' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This is the "standalone" version of this routine. It returns
*     the name of the currently executing file or command.
