void ndfFind_( const HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, int *indf, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfFind

*  Purpose:
*     Find an NDF and import it into the NDF_ system.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfFind( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, int *indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function finds an NDF within an HDS structure or container file,
*     imports it into the NDF_ system and issues an identifier for it. The
*     imported NDF may then be manipulated by the NDF_ functions.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator to the enclosing HDS structure.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the HDS
*        structure component to be imported.
*     *indf
*        Returned holding the NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value given for the "name" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an NDF can be
*     found in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of the structure
*     identified by the locator "loc".  Array subscripts may also be used
*     in this component name.  Thus a string such as
*     "MYSTRUC.ZONE(2).IMAGE" could be used as a valid "name" value.
*     -  An NDF can be accessed within an explicitly named container file
*     by supplying the symbolic value NULL for the "loc" parameter and
*     specifying the container file within the value supplied for the
*     "name" parameter. Only READ access is available to an NDF accessed in
*     this way (for other modes of access, see the ndfOpen function).
*     -  If a blank value is given for the "name" parameter, then the NDF
*     to be imported will be the object identified directly by the locator
*     "loc".
*     -  The locator supplied as input to this function may later be
*     annulled without affecting the behaviour of the NDF_ system.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason.
*     -  The NDF__NOID constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h". The
*     NULL constant is defined in the header file "dat_par.h" (see
*     SUN/92).
