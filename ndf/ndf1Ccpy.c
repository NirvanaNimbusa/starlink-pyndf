void ndf1Ccpy( const char *cin, char *cout, size_t cout_length, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Ccpy

*  Purpose:
*     Copy a character string, checking for truncation.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Ccpy( const char *cin, char *cout, size_t cout_length,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies a character string from one variable to another
*     and checking for truncation of trailing non-blank characters. If such
*     truncation occurs, then an error is reported and a "status" value set.

*  Parameters:
*     cin
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the input character
*        string.
*     cout
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated copy of
*        the input string.
*     cout_length
*        The length of the supplied 'cout' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.
