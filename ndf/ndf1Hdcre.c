void ndf1Hdcre( NdfDCB *dcb, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Hdcre

*  Purpose:
*     Create a history component for an NDF, if necessary.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hdcre( NdfDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that a history component exists for an NDF,
*     creating one if necessary. Associated locators are stored in the DCB.
*     The function returns without action if a history component already
*     exists.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to a DCB entry identifying the NDF for which a history
*        component is required.
*     *status
*        The global status.
