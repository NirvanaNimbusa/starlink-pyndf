void ndfBound_( int indf, int ndimx, hdsdim lbnd[], hdsdim ubnd[],

*  Name:
*     ndfBound

*  Purpose:
*     Enquire the pixel-index bounds of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfBound( int indf, int ndimx, hdsdim lbnd[], hdsdim ubnd[],
*                    int *ndim, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the lower and upper pixel-index bounds of each
*     dimension of an NDF, together with the total number of dimensions.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     ndimx
*        Maximum number of pixel-index bounds to return (i.e. the declared
*        size of the "lbnd" and "ubnd" arguments).
*     lbnd
*        Returned holding the lower pixel-index bounds for each dimension.
*        The supplied "lbnd" array should have at least "ndimx" elements.
*     ubnd
*        Returned holding the upper pixel-index bounds for each dimension.
*        The supplied "ubnd" array should have at least "ndimx" elements.
*     *ndim
*        Returned holding the total number of NDF dimensions.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the NDF has fewer than "ndimx" dimensions, then any remaining
*     elements of the "lbnd" and "ubnd" arguments will be filled with 1"s.
*     -  If the NDF has more than "ndimx" dimensions, then the "ndim"
*     parameter will return the actual number of dimensions. In this case
*     only the first "ndimx" sets of bounds will be returned, except that
*     an error will result if the size of any of the remaining dimensions
*     exceeds 1.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of 1
*     will be returned for all elements of the "lbnd" and "ubnd" arrays and
*     for the "ndim" parameter, although no further processing will occur.
*     The same values will also be returned if the function should fail for
*     any reason.
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__MXDIM may be used to declare the size
*     of the "lbnd" and "ubnd" arguments so that they will be able to hold
*     the maximum number of NDF bounds that this function can return. This
*     constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
