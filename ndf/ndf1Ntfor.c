void ndf1Ntfor( const char *forfil, NdfFCB *fcb, int keep, HDSLoc **ndfloc,

*  Name:
*     ndf1Ntfor

*  Purpose:
*     Identify a native NDF to be associated with a foreign file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Ntfor( const char *forfil, NdfFCB *fcb, int keep,
*                     HDSLoc **ndfloc, char *ndfnam, size_t ndfnam_length,
*                     size_t *lnam, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function accepts the name of a foreign format file from (or to)
*     which data conversion is to be performed and identifies an NDF object
*     which can be associated with it and used to hold the (converted)
*     native NDF format version of the data. The NDF name is obtained by
*     translating an appropriate environment variable. A default NDF name
*     is supplied if this does not yield a suitable result. The identified
*     NDF is not actually created by this function.

*  Parameters:
*     forfil
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        foreign format file, optionally ending with a foreign extension
*        specifier.
*     fcb
*        Pointer to an object describing the foreign file format (must be
*        non-NULL).
*     keep
*        If a non-zero value is supplied, it indicates that the NDF will be
*        kept. Otherwise it will be a temporary object.
*     *ndfloc
*        Returned holding the locator which, in conjunction with the
*        "ndfnam" value, identifies the NDF. On successful exit, this
*        locator will either have the root locator value NULL (in
*        which case "ndfnam" contains the full NDF name) or will be an
*        active locator (in which case "ndfnam" contains the relative name
*        of the NDF). If active, this locator should be annulled by the
*        caller when no longer required.
*     ndfnam
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding absolute or relative HDS name which, in conjunction with
*        the "ndfloc" value, identifies the NDF object.
*     ndfnam_length
*        The length of the supplied 'ndfnam' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *lnam
*        Returned holding the number of characters in the "ndfnam" value.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then an invalid
*     locator will be returned via the "ndfloc" parameter. The same value
*     will also be returned if this function should fail for any reason.
