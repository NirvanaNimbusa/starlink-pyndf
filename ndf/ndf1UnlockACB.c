void ndf1UnlockACB( NdfACB *acb, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1UnlockACB

*  Purpose:
*     Unlock an ACB so it can be locked subsequently by another thread.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1UnlockACB( NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function attempts to unlock the DCB associated with the
*     supplied ACB so it can later be locked using ndf1LockACB by another
*     thread. An error is reported if the DCB is currently locked by a
*     thread other than the current thread. If successfull, all other
*     ACBs associated with the same DCB are annulled. The context level
*     stored in the supplied ACB is set to a special value, NDF__INLIMBO,
*     indicating that the ACB is not in any context.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        The ACB to be unlocked.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if an error has already
*     occurred.
