void ndfXgt0c_( int indf, const char *xname, const char *cmpt, char *value,

*  Name:
*     ndfXgt0c

*  Purpose:
*     Read a scalar string from a component within a named NDF extension.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXgt0c( int indf, const char *xname, const char *cmpt,
*                    char *value, int value_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function reads a scalar string from a component within a named
*     NDF extension. The extension must already exist, although the
*     component within the extension need not exist (a default value,
*     established beforehand, will be returned if necessary).

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        extension.
*     cmpt
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        component within the extension whose value is to be obtained.
*     value
*        A buffer in which to place the string obtained from the extension
*        component.
*     value_length
*        The length of the supplied "value" buffer. This should include
*        room for a terminating null character.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value given for the "cmpt" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an object can
*     be accessed in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of an NDF
*     extension. Array subscripts may also be included. Thus a string such
*     as "CALIB.FILTER(3).WAVELENGTH" could be used as a valid "cmpt"
*     value.
*     -  If the requested component in the extension does not exist, then
*     the "value" parameter will be returned unchanged.  A suitable default
*     should therefore be established before this function is called.
*     -  If the length of the "value" parameter passed to the ndfXgt0c
*     function is too short to accommodate the returned result without
*     losing significant (non-blank) trailing characters, then this will
*     be indicated by an appended ellipsis, i.e. "...". No error will
*     result.
