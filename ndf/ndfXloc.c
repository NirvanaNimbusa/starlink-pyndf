*  Name:
*     ndfXloc

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain access to a named NDF extension via an HDS locator.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXloc( int indf, const char *xname, const char *mode,
*                   HDSLoc **loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an HDS locator to a named extension (if
*     present) in an NDF. An error results if the specified extension is
*     not present.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        required extension.
*     mode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mode of access
*        required to the extension: "READ", "UPDATE" or "WRITE".
*     *loc
*        Returned holding the extension locator.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If WRITE access is specified, then any existing extension contents
*     or values will be erased or reset, so that the extension is ready to
*     receive new values. If UPDATE access is specified, then existing
*     values will be retained so that they may be modified.
*     -  It is the caller's responsibility to annul the HDS locator issued
*     by this function (e.g. by calling "datAnnul") when it is no longer
*     required. The NDF_ system will not perform this task itself.
*     -  Although this function will check the access mode value supplied
*     against the available access to the NDF, HDS does not allow the
*     returned locator to be protected against write access in the case
*     where WRITE access to the NDF is available, but only READ access was
*     requested.  In this case it is the responsibility of the caller to
*     respect the locator access restriction.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then an invalid
*     locator will be returned for the "loc" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  At present, although the requested access mode will be checked
*     against the available access to the NDF, the returned locator may
*     allow WRITE access, even when only READ access was requested. This is
*     because HDS does not currently provide a means of explicitly
*     protecting a locator against write operations.
