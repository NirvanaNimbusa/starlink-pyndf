*  Name:
*     ndf1Mpanl

*  Purpose:
*     Analyse a Mapping into a set of parallel Mappings.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Mpanl( AstMapping *mapin, int *nmap, AstMapping *maps[],
*                     int hasinv[], int inmap[], int inind[], int outmap[],
*                     int outind[], AstMapping **map, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a set of Mappings that, when applied in
*     parallel, are equivalent to the supplied Mapping. Each returned
*     Mapping has the fewest possible number of inputs. Thus, the supplied
*     Mapping will be split up into the largest possible number of
*     Mappings.

*  Parameters:
*     mapin
*        AST pointer to the supplied Mapping.
*     *nmap
*        The number of Mappings returned.
*     maps
*        An array of "*nmap" returned Mapping pointers. Each of these
*        Mappings will have a defined inverse transformation. If the
*        supplied Mapping does not include an inverse for a particular
*        input, then the Mapping for that input will be a TranMap that
*        encapsulated the supplied forward Mapping and an inverse Mapping
*        that generates AST__BAD values. The supplied "maps" array should
*        have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     hasinv
*        An array of "*nmap" returned flags. Each one is set non-zero if the
*        correspnding Mapping in "maps" has an inverse transformation that
*        was inherited from the supplied Mapping, or zero if the inverse
*        transformation was created by this function. The supplied "hasinv"
*        array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     inmap
*        Element "i" is returned holding the index into the "maps" array
*        that holds the Mapping used to transforms input "i+1" in the
*        supplied Mapping (note, Mapping input and output indices are
*        1-based). The supplied "inmap" array should have at least
*        "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     inind
*        Element "i" is returned holding the (1-based) index of the input of
*        the Mapping identified by "inmap[i]" that corresponds to (1-based)
*        input "i+1" in the supplied Mapping. The supplied "inind" array
*        should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     outmap
*        Element "i" is returned holding the index into the "maps" array
*        that holds the Mapping that generates values for (1-based) output
*        index "i+1" in the supplied Mapping. The supplied "outmap" array
*        should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     outind
*        Element "i" is returned holding the (1-based) index of the output of
*        the Mapping identified by "outmap[i]" that corresponds to (1-based)
*        output "i+1" in the supplied Mapping. The supplied "outind" array
*        should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     *map
*        Returned holding a pointer to the full Mapping. This is
*        constructed by joining all the parallel Mappings back together
*        again, and so should always have an inverse transformation (so
*        long as the supplied Mapping can be split succesfully). If the
*        supplied Mapping cannot be split, a clone of the supplied Mapping
*        is returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.
