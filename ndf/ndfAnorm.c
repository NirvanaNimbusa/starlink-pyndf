*  Name:
*     ndfAnorm

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the logical value of an NDF axis normalisation flag.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfAnorm( int indf, int iaxis, int *norm, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a logical value for the normalisation flag
*     associated with an NDF axis.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     iaxis
*        Number of the axis whose normalisation flag value is required.
*     *norm
*        Returned holding the normalisation flag value.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A value of zero may be supplied for the "iaxis" parameter, in
*     which case the function will return the logical "OR" of the
*     normalisation flag values for all the NDF's axes.
