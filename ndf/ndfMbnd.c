void ndfMbnd_( const char *option, int *indf1, int *indf2, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfMbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Match the pixel-index bounds of a pair of NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMbnd( const char *option, int *indf1, int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function matches the pixel-index bounds of a pair of NDFs so
*     that their array components may be compared pixel-for-pixel during
*     subsequent processing. Matching is performed by selecting an
*     appropriate section from each NDF, the method used to define this
*     section being determined by the value given for the "option"
*     parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     option
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the this parameter
*        determines how the section to be selected from each NDF is
*        defined: "PAD" or "TRIM" (see the Notes section for details). Its
*        value may be abbreviated to 3 characters.
*     *indf1
*        Identifier for the first NDF whose pixel-index bounds are to be
*        matched.
*     *indf2
*        Identifier for the second NDF to be matched.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "option"="PAD" is specified, then the NDF bounds will be
*     matched by "padding"; i.e. each NDF will be extended by selecting the
*     smallest section from it which encompasses all the pixels in both
*     NDFs. In effect, the pixel-index bounds of the two NDFs are
*     "maximised" and the "union" of the two sets of pixels is selected.
*     Any new pixels introduced into either NDF will be padded with the
*     "bad" value.  If the NDFs have different numbers of dimensions, then
*     the dimensionality of both the returned sections will match the NDF
*     with the higher dimensionality.
*     -  If "option"="TRIM" is specified, then the NDF bounds will be
*     matched by "trimming"; i.e. each NDF will be restricted in extent by
*     selecting a section from it which encompasses only those pixels which
*     are present in both NDFs. In effect, the pixel-index bounds of the
*     two NDFs are "minimised" and the "intersection" of the two sets of
*     pixels is selected. An error will result if the two NDFs have no
*     pixels in common. If the NDFs have different numbers of dimensions,
*     then the dimensionality of both the returned sections will match the
*     NDF with the lower dimensionality.
*     -  Note that the initial NDF identifier values will be annulled by
*     this function and replaced with identifiers describing appropriate
*     new sections from the original NDFs. If access to the original data
*     is still required, then the initial identifiers may be cloned with
*     the function ndfClone before calling this function.
