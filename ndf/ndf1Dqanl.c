void ndf1Dqanl( NdfDCB *dcb, int del, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Dqanl

*  Purpose:
*     Annul the quality data object in an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Dqanl( NdfDCB *dcb, int del, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function performs an annul operation on the DCB items describing
*     the quality data object in an NDF as part of anulling the DCB entry
*     for the NDF itself. If no DCB information about the quality component
*     is available, then no action is taken. Otherwise, the DCB items
*     relating to this component are annulled and the quality data object
*     deleted if necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the DCB entry.
*     del
*        Whether the annul operation is to result in deletion of the data
*        object.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function will attempt to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
