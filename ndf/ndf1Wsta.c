*  Name:
*     ndf1Wsta

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the state of the WCS component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Wsta( NdfACB *acb, int *state, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a logical value indicating if the WCS component
*     of an NDF is defined. The NDF is identified by its ACB entry.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's ACB entry.
*     *state
*        Returned holding the whether the WCS component is defined (non-
*        zero for defined, zero for undefined).
*     *status
*        The global status.
