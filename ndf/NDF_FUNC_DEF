*  Name:
*     NDF_FUNC_DEF

*  Purpose:
*     Define statement functions for the NDF_ system.

*  Language:
*     Unix Fortran

*  Type of Module:
*     Function definition include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines statement functions which are used internally by
*     the NDF_ system and which may also be used by other software which
*     calls NDF_ routines.

*  Notes:
*     -  This file exists to encapsulate functions which require
*     non-portable Fortran and which may therefore need to be
*     implemented differently on different machines. It should be
*     preceded by the include file NDF_DEC which declares the functions
*     defined here together with their arguments.

*     Name:
*        NDF_QMASK

*     Purpose:
*        Determine if an NDF quality value and a "bad-bits" mask
*        dictate that an NDF pixel be included in processing.

*     Invocation:
*        (LOGICAL) RESULT = NDF_QMASK( QUAL, BADBIT )

*     Arguments:
*        QUAL = BYTE (Given)
*           The unsigned byte quality value.
*        BADBIT = BYTE (Given)
*           The unsigned byte "bad-bits" mask.

*     Result:
*        NDF_QMASK = LOGICAL (Returned)
*           A .TRUE. value is returned if the bit-wise "AND" of the
*           quality and bad-bits values is zero, indicating that the NDF
*           pixel is not excluded by its quality value and should be
*           included in processing. Otherwise, a .FALSE. value is
*           returned, indicating that the pixel should be excluded from
*           processing.

      NDF_QMASK( NDF_ARGB1, NDF_ARGB2 ) =
     :   IAND( NDF_ARGB1, NDF_ARGB2 ) .EQ. 0
