*  Name:
*     ndfSize

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the size of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSize( int indf, size_t *npix, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the number of pixels in the NDF whose
*     identifier is supplied (i.e. the product of its dimensions).

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *npix
*        Returned holding the number of pixels in the NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of 1
*     will be returned for the "npix" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur.  The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
