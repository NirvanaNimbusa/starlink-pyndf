*  Name:
*     ndf1Simlr

*  Purpose:
*     Case insensitive string comparison, permitting abbreviation.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ndf1Simlr( const char *str1, size_t start, size_t end,
*                    const char *str2, int n )

*  Description:
*     The function returns a logical result indicating whether two strings
*     are the same apart from case. In assessing this, the first string is
*     allowed to be an abbreviation of the second string, so long as it
*     contains a specified minimum number of characters.

*  Parameters:
*     str1
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the first string,
*        which may be an abbreviation.
*     start
*        The zero-based index of the first character to consider in "str1".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     end
*        The zero-based index of the last character to consider in "str1".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     str2
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the second string.
*     n
*        The minimum number of characters to which the first string may be
*        abbreviated (although a smaller number will be accepted if there
*        are actually fewer than "n" characters in "str2").

*  Returned Value:
*     Whether the two strings match after allowing for case and
*     abbreviation of the first string to no less than N characters.
