void ndfHend_( int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfHend

*  Purpose:
*     End NDF history recording for the current application.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHend( int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function closes down history recording for the current
*     application by writing default history information (when appropriate)
*     to any NDFs which are still active, and by flagging that a new
*     history record should be created to hold any subsequent history
*     information (ready for the next application). If an application name
*     has been declared via a call to ndfHappn, then that name is cleared.

*  Parameters:
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  This function should not normally be used by writers of NDF
*     applications. It is provided primarily to allow those writing
*     environment-level software to identify the end of an application to
*     the NDF_ system in circumstances where more than one application may
*     be invoked from within a single executing program. Even then, it will
*     not normally be needed unless NDF data structures are intended to
*     remain open throughout the invocation of several applications and a
*     separate history record is required from each application.
