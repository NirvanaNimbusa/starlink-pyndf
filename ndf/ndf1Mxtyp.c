*  Name:
*     ndf1Mxtyp

*  Purpose:
*     Maximise two numeric data type codes.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Mxtyp( int itype1, int itype2, int *itype, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function compares two integer codes representing numeric data
*     types and "maximises" them. It returns a new type code representing
*     the numeric data type with the lowest precision such that data stored
*     using either of the input data types can be converted to the new type
*     without loss of precision.

*  Parameters:
*     itype1
*        First numeric type code.
*     itype2
*        Second numeric type code.
*     *itype
*        Returned holding the "maximised" type code.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The type codes which this function uses are symbolic constants
*     with names of the form NDF__TYPx (where x indicates the numeric
*     type). These constants are defined in the header file "ndf1.h".
*     -  The implementation of this function depends on the collating
*     sequence for numeric data types established by the definitions of
*     these type codes.
