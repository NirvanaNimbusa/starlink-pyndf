void ndfSbnd_( int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[], const hdsdim ubnd[], int indf,

*  Name:
*     ndfSbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Set new pixel-index bounds for an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfSbnd( int ndim, const hdsdim lbnd[], const hdsdim ubnd[],
*                   int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets new pixel-index bounds for an NDF (or NDF
*     section). The number of NDF dimensions may also be changed. If a base
*     NDF is specified, then a permanent change is made to the actual data
*     object and this will be apparent through any other NDF identifiers
*     which refer to it. However, if an identifier for an NDF section is
*     specified, then its bounds are altered without affecting other
*     identifiers.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim
*        New number of NDF dimensions.
*     lbnd
*        New lower pixel-index bounds of the NDF.
*     ubnd
*        New upper pixel-index bounds of the NDF.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The bounds of an NDF section cannot be altered while any of its
*     array components (or any of its axis arrays) is mapped for access
*     through the identifier supplied to this function.
*     -  The bounds of a base NDF cannot be altered while any part of any
*     of its array components (or any of its axis arrays) is mapped for
*     access, even through another identifier.
*     -  The pixel values of any defined NDF array component will be
*     retained if those pixels lie within both the old and new bounds. Any
*     pixels lying outside the new bounds will be lost and cannot later be
*     recovered by further changes to the NDF's bounds. Any new pixels
*     introduced where the new bounds extend beyond the old ones will be
*     assigned the "bad" value, and subsequent enquiries about the presence
*     of bad pixels will reflect this.
*     -  If the new NDF bounds extend beyond the bounds of the associated
*     base NDF and any of the NDF's axis arrays have defined values, then
*     these values will be extrapolated as necessary.
*     -  If the bounds of a base NDF are to be altered and retention of the
*     pixel values of any of its components is not required, then a call to
*     ndfReset should be made before calling this function. This will
*     eliminate any unnecessary processing which might be needed to retain
*     the existing values. This step is not necessary with an NDF section,
*     as no processing of pixel values takes place in this case.
