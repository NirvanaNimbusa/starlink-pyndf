*  Name:
*     ndfHnrec

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the number of NDF history records present.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHnrec( int indf, int *nrec, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a count of the number of history records
*     present in an NDF.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *nrec
*        Returned holding the number of history records.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The number of records returned may be zero if a history component
*     exists but no history information has yet been entered.
*     -  An error will result if there is no history component present in
*     the NDF.
