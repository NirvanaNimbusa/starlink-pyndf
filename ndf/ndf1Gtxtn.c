*  Name:
*     ndf1Gtxtn

*  Purpose:
*     Get a list of NDF extension names from the environment.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Gtxtn( const char *name, int mxxtn, int *def, char *xtn,
*                     size_t xtn_length, size_t xtn1[], size_t xtn2[],
*                     int *nxtn, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function obtains a list of NDF extension names from the
*     environment and parses and validates this list. It is intended for
*     obtaining lists of extensions which are to be recognised when
*     converting to or from foreign format data files.

*  Parameters:
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        environment variable which contains the list.
*     mxxtn
*        Maximum number of extension names that can be accommodated.
*     *def
*        Returned holding the whether the environment variable was defined.
*     xtn
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the translation of the specified environment variable,
*        with all extension name fields validated and converted to upper
*        case.
*     xtn_length
*        The length of the supplied 'xtn' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     xtn1
*        Returned holding the character positions in the "xtn" string at
*        which each extension name field begins. The supplied "xtn1" array
*        should have at least "mxxtn" elements.
*     xtn2
*        Returned holding the character positions in the "xtn" string at
*        which each extension name field ends. The supplied "xtn2" array
*        should have at least "mxxtn" elements.
*     *nxtn
*        Returned holding the number of extension names found.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If the specified environment variable is not defined, then "def" will
*     be set to zero and no further extension name information will be
*     returned.
