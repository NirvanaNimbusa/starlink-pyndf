*  Name:
*     ndf1Ssdup

*  Purpose:
*     Duplicate an array section.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Ssdup( Ary *ary1, Ary *ary2, Ary **ary3, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function creates a "similar section" from an array (whose ARY_
*     system identifier is supplied) using an existing array section as a
*     template.  The new array section will bear the same relationship to
*     its base array as the template does to its own base array.
*
*     Note that this function is the same as "arySsect" (q.v.), except that
*     the number of output section dimensions matches the template array,
*     rather than the original input array.

*  Parameters:
*     ary1
*        ARY_ system identifier for the array, or array section, from which
*        the new section is to be drawn.
*     ary2
*        ARY_ system identifier for the template array section (may also be
*        a base array).
*     *ary3
*        Returned holding the ARY_ system identifier for the new array
*        section.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of NULL
*     will be returned for the "ary3" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
