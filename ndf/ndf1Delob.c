void ndf1Delob( HDSLoc **loc, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Delob

*  Purpose:
*     Delete an HDS object (and all sub-objects).

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Delob( HDSLoc **loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function recursively deletes an HDS object (and all sub-objects)
*     passed by locator, and also annuls the locator. The object may be a
*     top-level object, in which case the container file itself will be
*     deleted. If the object is a cell or slice from a structure array,
*     then it will simply be emptied (i.e. all its components will be
*     erased).

*  Parameters:
*     *loc
*        Locator to the HDS object to be deleted. This will be annulled,
*        and a value of DAT__NOLOC will be returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function will attempt to execute even if it is called with
*     "status" set, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  This function will handle top-level HDS objects and should always
*     be used if the object may be a top level object. In cases where the
*     object is known to be a sub-component, the ndf1Antmp function may be
*     called (and will be more efficient).
*     -  An error will result and a "status" value of NDF__BNDIN will be
*     returned (unless "status" was set on entry) if an attempt is made to
*     delete a cell or slice of a primitive HDS array.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  The method by which this function determines if it has been passed
*     a cell from a structure array is rather unsatisfactory. This should
*     be improved when facilities for obtaining this information become
*     available in HDS.
