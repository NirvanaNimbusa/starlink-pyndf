*  Name:
*     ndf1Htlen

*  Purpose:
*     Return the length of the text in the current history record.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Htlen( NdfDCB *dcb, size_t *htlen, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the length of the text in the current history
*     record, as determined from the HDS locators stored in the DCB.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the NDF whose history is to be modified.
*     *htlen
*        Returned holding the length of the text in the current history
*        record.
*     *status
*        The global status.
