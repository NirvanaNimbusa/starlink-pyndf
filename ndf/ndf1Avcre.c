*  Name:
*     ndf1Avcre

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that an NDF axis variance array exists, creating one if
*     necessary.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Avcre( int iax, NdfDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that an axis variance array exists for an NDF
*     with an entry in the DCB. If the data object does not currently have
*     an axis variance array, then one is created.  An NDF axis coordinate
*     system is first created by this function if necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     iax
*        Zero based axis index.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the data object entry in the DCB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Any variance array created is left in an undefined state by this
*     function.
