void ndfEnd_( int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfEnd

*  Purpose:
*     End the current NDF context.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfEnd( int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ends the current NDF context, causing all NDF
*     identifiers and placeholders created within that context (i.e. since
*     a matching call to ndfBegin) to be annulled. Any mapped values
*     associated with these identifiers are unmapped, and any temporary
*     NDFs which no longer have identifiers associated with them are
*     deleted.

*  Parameters:
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Matching pairs of calls to ndfBegin and ndfEnd may be nested. An
*     error will be reported if ndfEnd is called without a corresponding
*     call to ndfBegin.
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
