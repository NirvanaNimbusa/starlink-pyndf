*  Name:
*     ndf1Hcopy

*  Purpose:
*     Copy all the components of one HDS structure into another structure.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hcopy( HDSLoc *loc1, HDSLoc *loc2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies all the components in an HDS structure into
*     another structure preserving their names. Any components in the
*     destination structure are first deleted.

*  Parameters:
*     loc1
*        Locator to input HDS structure.
*     loc2
*        Locator to the HDS structure which is to receive the copied
*        components.
*     *status
*        The global status.
