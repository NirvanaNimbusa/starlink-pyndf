*  Name:
*     ndfAmap

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain mapped access to an NDF axis array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfAmap( int indf, const char *comp, int iaxis,
*                    const char *type, const char *mmod, void *pntr[],
*                    size_t *el, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function obtains mapped access to an NDF axis array, returning a
*     pointer to the mapped values and a count of the number of elements
*     mapped.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the axis
*        array component to be mapped: "CENTRE", "VARIANCE" (or "ERROR") or
*        "WIDTH".
*     iaxis
*        Number of the NDF axis whose array is to be mapped.
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the numeric type to be
*        used for access (e.g. "_REAL").
*     mmod
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mapping mode for
*        access to the array: "READ", "UPDATE" or "WRITE".
*     pntr
*        Returned holding the pointer(s) to the mapped values (see the
*        Notes section).
*     *el
*        Returned holding the number of elements mapped.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of axis array component names may also be
*     given, in which case the function will map all the requested axis
*     arrays using the same numeric type and mapping mode. Pointers to the
*     values of these mapped arrays will be returned (in the specified
*     order) in the elements of the array "pntr", which must be of
*     sufficient size to accommodate them.
