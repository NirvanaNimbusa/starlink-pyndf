void ndfStype_( const char *ftype, int indf, const char *comp, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfStype

*  Purpose:
*     Set a new type for an NDF array component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfStype( const char *ftype, int indf, const char *comp,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets a new full type for an NDF array component,
*     causing its storage type to be changed. If the component's values are
*     defined, they will be converted from from the old type to the new
*     one. If they are undefined, then no conversion will be necessary.
*     Subsequent enquiries will reflect the new type. Conversion may be
*     performed between any types supported by the NDF_ functions,
*     including from a non-complex type to a complex type (and vice versa).

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the new full type
*        specification for the NDF component (e.g. "_REAL" or
*        "COMPLEX_INTEGER").
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the array
*        component whose type is to be set: "DATA" or "VARIANCE".
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The function may only be used to change the type of a component of
*     a base NDF. If it is called for an NDF which is not a base NDF, then
*     it will return without action. No error will result.
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the type of each component will be set to the same value
*     in turn.
*     -  An error will result if a component being modified, or any part of
*     it, is currently mapped for access (e.g. through another identifier).
*     -  If the type of a component is to be changed without its values
*     being retained, then a call to ndfReset should be made beforehand.
*     This will avoid the cost of converting all the values.
