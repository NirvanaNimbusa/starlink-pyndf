*  Name:
*     NDF_QMASK

*  Purpose:
*     Combine an NDF quality value with a bad-bits mask to give a
*     logical result.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     RESULT = NDF_QMASK( QUAL, BADBIT )

*  Description:
*     This function may be used to combine an NDF quality array value
*     with the associated bad-bits mask value to derive a logical
*     result indicating whether an NDF pixel should be included or
*     excluded from processing by general-purpose software.

*  Arguments:
*     QUAL = BYTE (Given)
*        The unsigned byte quality value.
*     BADBIT = BYTE (Given)
*        The unsigned byte bad-bits mask value.

*  Returned Value:
*     NDF_QMASK = LOGICAL
*        If the function returns a .TRUE. result, then the pixel with
*        quality value QUAL should be included in processing by
*        general-purpose software. If it returns a .FALSE. result, then
*        the pixel should be regarded as "bad" and excluded from
*        processing.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is implemented as a Fortran statement function
*     and should be defined in each program unit from which it is
*     invoked by means of the include file NDF_FUNC. This file should
*     normally be included immediately after any local variable
*     declarations.
*     -  The result of this function is computed by forming the
*     bit-wise "AND" between the QUAL and BADBIT values and testing the
*     result for equality with zero. Its actual implementation is
*     machine-dependent.
