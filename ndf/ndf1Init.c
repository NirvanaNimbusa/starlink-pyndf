*  Name:
*     ndf1Init

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the global and per-thread data used by the NDF library.

*  Synopsis:
*     int *ndf1Init( int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that all necessary initialisation - both
*     of global data and of thread-specific data - has been done.
*     It should be the first thing called in each public NDF function.
*     Amonst other things, it tells the AST library to use the supplied
*     status pointer.

*  Parameters:
*     status
*        The global status. If this is NULL, the AST internal status
*        pointer is established.

*  Returned Value:
*     The original AST status pointer. This value should be re-established
*     by calling astWatch before the calling NDF function exists.
