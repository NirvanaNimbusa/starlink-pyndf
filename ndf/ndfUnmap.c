*  Name:
*     ndfUnmap

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an NDF or a mapped NDF array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfUnmap( int indf, const char *comp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function unmaps an NDF, or an individual NDF array which has
*     previously been mapped for READ, UPDATE or WRITE access.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        component to be unmapped: "AXIS", "DATA", "QUALITY", "VARIANCE" or
*        "*". The last value acts as a wild card, causing all mapped arrays
*        to be unmapped.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  A component name of "AXIS" will act as a partial wild card,
*     unmapping any axis arrays which are mapped, but leaving other
*     components unchanged. The function ndfAunmp may be used to unmap
*     individual axis arrays.
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be given, in
*     which case each component will be unmapped in turn.
*     -  An error will be reported if a component has not previously been
*     mapped for access, except in the case where a value of "*" is given
*     for "comp", or where "AXIS" is used to unmap axis arrays.
