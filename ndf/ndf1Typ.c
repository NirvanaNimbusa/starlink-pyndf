void ndf1Typ( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int *itype, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Typ

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the numeric data type of an NDF array component identified by
*     its ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Typ( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int *itype, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the numeric data type of one of the array
*     components of an NDF as an upper case character string.  The NDF is
*     identified by its entry in the ACB.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's entry in the ACB.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component whose type is required; "DATA", "QUALITY" or
*        "VARIANCE".
*     *itype
*        Returned holding the numeric data type code of the component; a
*        symbolic constant with a name of the form NDF__TYPx, where x
*        identifies the data type (these constants are defined in the
*        header file "ndf1.h").
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of NDF component names may also be supplied
*     to this function. In this case the result returned will be the
*     integer code for the data type with the lowest precision such that
*     the values held in any of the specified components can be converted
*     to that type without loss of numerical precision.
