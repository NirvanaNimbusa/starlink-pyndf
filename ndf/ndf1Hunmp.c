void ndf1Hunmp( HDSLoc *loc, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Hunmp

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an HDS primitive object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hunmp( HDSLoc *loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function unmaps an HDS object which has previously been mapped.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator to HDS object.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function exists because the "datUnmap" function doesn't
*     execute if "status" is set on entry. Thus, mapped data could
*     potentially remain unnecessarily mapped following recovery from an
*     error.
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
