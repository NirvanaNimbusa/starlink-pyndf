*  Name:
*     ndf1Fsplt

*  Purpose:
*     Split a file name into directory, name, type and version fields.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Fsplt( const char *fname, size_t start, size_t end, size_t *d1,
*                     size_t *d2, size_t *n1, size_t *n2, size_t *t1, size_t *t2,
*                     size_t *v1, size_t *v2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function splits a full file name into a directory field, a name
*     field, a type field (which contains a leading ".") and a version
*     field and returns the character positions of the start and end of
*     each field.

*  Parameters:
*     fname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the file
*        specification.
*     start
*        The zero-based index of the first character to consider in "fname".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     end
*        The zero-based index of the last character to consider in "fname".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     *d1
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the first character
*        in the directory field.
*     *d2
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the last character
*        in the directory field.
*     *n1
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the first character
*        in the file name field.
*     *n2
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the last character in
*        the file name field.
*     *t1
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the first character in
*        the type field.
*     *t2
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the last character in
*        the type field.
*     *v1
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the first character
*        in the version field.
*     *v2
*        Returned holding the zero-based position of the last character in
*        the version field.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If the supplied file name contains no directory field, then "d2"
*     is returned less than "d1", if it contains no name field, then "n2"
*     is returned less than "n1", if it contains no type field, then "t2"
*     is returned less than "t1", and if it contains no version field, then
*     "v2" is returned less than "v1".
*     -  The directory field ends at the last "/" and the type
*     field begins at the last "." (if any) which follows this. As there is
*     no version field, "v2" will always be returned less than "v1".

*  Machine-specific features used:
*     This function unavoidably has to make assumptions about the form of
*     POSIX file names.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     The file name supplied should be in a fully expanded form. If it
*     contains environment variables, then it is not guaranteed that the
*     file name syntax can be correctly analysed.
