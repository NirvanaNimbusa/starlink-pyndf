void ndf1Wwrt( AstFrameSet *iwcs, NdfDCB *dcb, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Wwrt

*  Purpose:
*     Write WCS information to an entry in the DCB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Wwrt( AstFrameSet *iwcs, NdfDCB *dcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function stores new WCS (World Coordinate System) information in
*     a data object with an entry in the DCB, over-writing any information
*     that may already be present.

*  Parameters:
*     iwcs
*        A pointer to an AST_ object which contains the coordinate system
*        information to be written. This should be a pointer to a FrameSet
*        satisfying all the requirements imposed by the NDF_ library, but
*        this function makes no check on this and any valid AST_ pointer
*        will be accepted and used. The AST_ object itself is not modified
*        by this function.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the data object entry in the DCB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - This function stores a cloned pointer to the AST_ object supplied
*     (not a copy) in the DCB.
