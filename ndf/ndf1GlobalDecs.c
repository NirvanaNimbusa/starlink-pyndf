*  Name:
*     ndf1GlobalDecs

*  Purpose:
*     Declare all global variables used within the NDF library.

*  Description:
*     This module is simply a collection of global variable declarations
*     (no executable code). Functions that need to access these variables
*     should include "ndf1_type.h", which includes "extern" statements
*     for each of these variables.
*
*     Accessing global variables in a multi-threaded context can lead to
*     simultaneous read and writes, with unpredictable results.
*     Therefore, all access to these variables should be serialised using
*     the associated mutex as described below. Macros that can be used to
*     lock and unlock these mutexes are defined in "ndf1_type.h".
