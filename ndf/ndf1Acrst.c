*  Name:
*     ndf1Acrst

*  Purpose:
*     Reset an axis character component to an undefined state.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Acrst( int iax, int iccomp, NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function resets an axis character component of an NDF to an
*     undefined state by erasing the associated data object.

*  Parameters:
*     iax
*        Axis number.
*     iccomp
*        Axis character component identifier: ndfAlab or ndfAuni (as
*        defined in the header file "ndf1.h").
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function can only be used to reset an axis character
*     component via a base NDF. If an NDF section is supplied, then it will
*     return without action. No error will result.
