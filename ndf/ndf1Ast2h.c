*  Name:
*     ndf1Ast2h

*  Purpose:
*     Copy AST_ data to an HDS object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Ast2h( char *data[], size_t data_length, int iline,
*                     const char *line, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies a line of text representing AST_ data into a
*     specified element of a 1-dimensional character array. It is intended
*     for use when writing AST_ data to an HDS object (i.e an HDS _CHAR
*     array).

*  Parameters:
*     data
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the character array
*        into which the text is to be copied.
*     data_length
*        The length of the supplied 'data' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     iline
*        The index of the element in "data" which is to receive the text
*        (the contents of other elements are returned unchanged).
*     line
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the line of text to be
*        inserted.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This function departs from the conventional parameter order so as to
*     accommodate the case where the "data" parameter is a mapped HDS
*     character array.
