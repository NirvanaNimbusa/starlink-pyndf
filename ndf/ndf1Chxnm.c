*  Name:
*     ndf1Chxnm

*  Purpose:
*     Check an NDF extension name.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Chxnm( const char *xname, size_t start, size_t end, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks the name of an NDF extension for standard form.
*     A standard name must be no more than NDF__SZXNM characters long, must
*     begin with an alphabetic character and continue with alphanumeric
*     characters (including underscore) only. If this test fails, then an
*     error is reported and a "status" value set. Otherwise, the function
*     returns without action.

*  Parameters:
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the extension name to
*        be checked.
*     start
*        The zero-based index of the first character to consider in "xname".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     end
*        The zero-based index of the last character to consider in "xname".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     *status
*        The global status.
