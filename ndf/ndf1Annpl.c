void ndf1Annpl( int erase, NdfPCB **pcb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Annpl

*  Purpose:
*     Annul an NDF placeholder.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Annpl( int erase, NdfPCB **pcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function annuls an NDF placeholder, releasing the PCB slot which
*     it occupies and optionally erasing the object associated with it.

*  Parameters:
*     erase
*        Whether to erase the associated object.
*     *pcb
*        Pointer to placeholder entry in the PCB. A value of zero is
*        returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Regardless of the value of the "erase" parameter, the associated
*     placeholder object will not be deleted unless its entry in the PCB
*     indicates that it was created by the NDF_ system (rather than being a
*     pre-existing object supplied by the caller).
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
