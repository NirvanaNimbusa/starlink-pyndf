*  Name:
*     ndf1Cvcmd

*  Purpose:
*     Get a data format conversion command for a foreign file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cvcmd( const char *forfil, NdfFCB *fcb, HDSLoc *ndfloc,
*                     const char *ndfnam, int from, int report, int *def,
*                     char *cmd, size_t cmd_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the conversion command which converts between a
*     foreign format data file and a native format NDF object (or vice
*     versa) by translating the appropriate environment variable.

*  Parameters:
*     forfil
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        foreign format file, optionally containing a foreign extension
*        specifier.
*     fcb
*        Pointer to an object describing the format of the foreign file
*        (must be non-NULL).
*     ndfloc
*        Locator which, in conjunction with the "ndfnam" parameter,
*        identifies the native format NDF object. If a value of NULL
*        is given, then "ndfnam" should contain the absolute name of this
*        object.
*     ndfnam
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the relative HDS name
*        of the native format NDF object (or the absolute name if "ndfloc"
*        is set to NULL).
*     from
*        If a non-zero value is given, conversion is from the foreign
*        format to native NDF format. Otherwise the reverse conversion is
*        performed.
*     report
*        If a non-zero value is given, then an error is reported if the
*        conversion command is not defined.
*     *def
*        Returned holding a non-zero value if the requested conversion
*        command is defined.
*     cmd
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the conversion command. The supplied character variable
*        should be at least NDF__SZCVT characters long.
*     cmd_length
*        The length of the supplied 'cmd' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.
