/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Psfmt

*  Purpose:
*     Parse a foreign data format specification.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Psfmt( const char *fmt, size_t *f1, size_t *f2, size_t *e1,
*                     size_t *e2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function parses a foreign data format specification of the form
*     NAME(.ext) and locates the "NAME" and ".ext" fields which contain the
*     data format name and the associated file type extension string.
*     Extraneous blanks are ignored and the specificaton is checked for
*     validity.

*  Parameters:
*     fmt
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the foreign data
*        format specification to be parsed.
*     *f1
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the start
*        of the "NAME" field.
*     *f2
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the end
*        of the "NAME" field.
*     *e1
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the start
*        of the ".ext" field.
*     *e2
*        Returned holding the zero-based character position of the end
*        of the ".ext" field.
*     *status
*        The global status.
