void ndf1Vsftp( const char *ftype, NdfACB *acb, int *status ){
/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Vsftp

*  Purpose:
*     Set a new full data type for the variance component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Vsftp( const char *ftype, NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets a new full data type for the variance component of
*     an NDF. If the component is defined, then its data values will be
*     converted as necessary. The NDF is identified by its ACB index.

*  Parameters:
*     ftype
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the new full data
*        type.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's ACB entry.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The data type of the variance component of an NDF cannot be
*     changed with this function while mapped access to any part of it is
*     in effect.
*     -  The data type of the variance component of an NDF section cannot
*     be changed with this function. If the NDF specified is not a base
*     NDF, then it will return without action.
