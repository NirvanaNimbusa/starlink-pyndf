*  Name:
*     ndf1Qfrm

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the storage form of the quality component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Qfrm( NdfACB *acb, char *form, size_t form_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the storage form of the quality component of an
*     NDF identified by its index in the ACB. The storage form is returned
*     as an upper case character string.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry identifying the NDF.
*     form
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the storage form.
*     form_length
*        The length of the supplied 'form' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.
