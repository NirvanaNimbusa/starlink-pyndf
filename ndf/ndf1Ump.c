void ndf1Ump( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Ump

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an ACB entry or one of its components.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Ump( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function unmaps components of an NDF which have previously been
*     mapped for access. The NDF is identified by its ACB entry. The
*     function will either unmap a specified list of components of the NDF
*     (in which case an error will be reported if any of those components
*     has not previously been mapped), or can perform a "wild carded"
*     unmapping operation on all those components which have been mapped
*     (which could be none).

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry to be unmapped.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name(s) of the NDF
*        component(s) to be unmapped; "DATA", "QUALITY", "VARIANCE" or "*"
*        (case insensitive). The last value acts as a wild card, causing
*        all mapped components to be unmapped.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function attempts to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  If the "AXIS" component is specified, then all mapped axis array
*     will be unmapped. In this case, no error will occur if there are no
*     mapped axis arrays.
