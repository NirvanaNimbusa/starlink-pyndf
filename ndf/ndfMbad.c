*  Name:
*     ndfMbad

*  Purpose:
*     Merge the bad-pixel flags of the array components of a pair of NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMbad( int badok, int indf1, int indf2, const char *comp,
*                   int check, int *bad, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function merges the bad-pixel flag values of an array component
*     (or components) for a pair of NDFs, returning the logical "OR" of the
*     separate values for each NDF. In addition, if bad pixels are found to
*     be present in either NDF but the application indicates that it cannot
*     correctly handle such values, then an error to this effect is
*     reported and a "status" value is set.

*  Parameters:
*     badok
*        Whether the application can correctly handle NDF array components
*        containing bad pixel values.
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the first NDF whose bad-pixel flag value is to be
*        merged.
*     indf2
*        Identifier for the second NDF.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component: "DATA", "QUALITY" or "VARIANCE".
*     check
*        Whether to perform explicit checks to see whether bad pixels are
*        actually present. (This parameter performs the same function as in
*        the function ndfBad.)
*     *bad
*        Returned holding the combined bad-pixel flag value (the logical
*        "OR" of the values obtained for each NDF).
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied, in
*     which case the function will take the logical "OR" of all the
*     specified components when calculating the combined bad-pixel flag
*     value.
*     -  The effective value of the bad-pixel flag for each NDF array
*     component which this function uses is the same as would be returned
*     by a call to the function ndfBad.
*     -  If this function detects the presence of bad pixels which the
*     application cannot support (as indicated by a zero value for the
*     "badok" parameter), then an error will be reported to this effect and
*     a "status" value of NDF__BADNS (bad pixels not supported) will be
*     returned.  The value of the "bad" parameter will be set to non-zero
*     under these circumstances. The NDF__BADNS constant is defined in the
*     header file "ndf_err.h".
