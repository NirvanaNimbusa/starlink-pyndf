*  Name:
*     ndf1Psnde

*  Purpose:
*     Parse an NDF dimension bounds expression.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Psnde( const char *str, int nax, const double lbnd[],
*                     const double ubnd[], AstFrameSet *iwcs, int wcssec,
*                     double value1[], double value2[], int *nval,
*                     int frame1[], int frame2[], int isbnd[],
*                     int isdef1[], int isdef2[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function parses an NDF section bound expression (such as
*     "1:10,2", "3:,,~7" or "31~5,,6") and returns two values specifying
*     the section's bounds in each dimension, together with additional
*     information specifying how the bounds should be calculated from the
*     returned values. Suitable defaults are used where appropriate.

*  Parameters:
*     str
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string containing
*        the expression to be parsed.
*     nax
*        Number of axes for which default bounds are available. If "wcssec"
*        is non-zero, this should be the number of WCS axes. Otherwise it
*        should be the number of pixel axes.
*     lbnd
*        Axis lower bounds (used to calculate defaults). These should be
*        pixel coordinates. The supplied "lbnd" array should have at least
*        "nax" elements.
*     ubnd
*        Axis upper bounds (used to calculate defaults). These should be
*        WCS axis values if "wcssec" is non-zero, and should be pixel
*        coordinates otherwise. The supplied "ubnd" array should have at
*        least "nax" elements.
*     iwcs
*        An AST pointer to the NDF's WCS FrameSet.
*     wcssec
*        If non-zero, then the section specifier uses WCS syntax.
*        Otherwise, it uses the old pixel/axis syntax. In WCS syntax, the
*        supplied "str" string should contain a specification for the
*        bounds on each WCS axis, supplied in the order of the WCS axes.
*        Each bound specification must be given using WCS axis values. The
*        number of bounds specifications must equal the number of WCS axes
*        (supplied in "nax"). If "wcssec" is zero, the supplied "str"
*        string should contain a specification for the bounds on each pixel
*        axis, supplied in the order of the pixel axes. Each bound
*        specification must be given using either pixel indices (integers),
*        or WCS axis values.
*     value1
*        Returned holding the first value specifying section bounds for
*        each dimension. The supplied "value1" array should have at least
*        "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     value2
*        Returned holding the second value specifying section bounds for
*        each dimension. The supplied "value2" array should have at least
*        "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     *nval
*        Number of axes for which values are returned (cannot exceed
*        NDF__MXDIM).
*     frame1
*        Returned holding the 0 ==> the corresponding "value1" value is to
*        be interpreted as a WCS or axis coordinate value, 1 ==> it is a
*        pixel index, 2 ==> it is a FRACTION value. The supplied "frame1"
*        array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     frame2
*        Returned holding the 0 ==> the corresponding "value2" value is to
*        be interpreted as a WCS or axis coordinate value, 1 ==> it is a
*        pixel index, 2 ==> it is a FRACTION value. The supplied "frame2"
*        array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM" elements.
*     isbnd
*        Returned holding the non-zero ==> the corresponding "value1" and
*        "value2" values specify the lower and upper bounds of the section
*        directly, zero ==> "value1" specifies the centre of the
*        dimension's extent and "value2" specifies the dimension's size.
*        The supplied "isbnd" array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM"
*        elements.
*     isdef1
*        Returned holding the non-zero ==> the corresponding "value1" value
*        is a default value and was not specified in the supplied string.
*        zero ==> "value1" was specified explicitly in the supplied string.
*        The supplied "isdef1" array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM"
*        elements.
*     isdef2
*        Returned holding the non-zero ==> the corresponding "value2" value
*        is a default value and was not specified in the supplied string.
*        zero ==> "value2" was specified explicitly in the supplied string.
*        The supplied "isdef2" array should have at least "NDF__MXDIM"
*        elements.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The number of dimension bounds implied by the expression supplied
*     (one more than the number of separating commas which it contains)
*     must not exceed NDF__MXDIM. An error will be reported if it does. It
*     need not match the number of NDF dimensions supplied.
