void ndf1Qityp( int dtype, int itype, int *ok, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Qityp

*  Purpose:
*     Query if a data type matches an implemented algorithm.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Qityp( int dtype, int itype, int *ok, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function compares a numeric data type with the data type of an
*     algorithm which may be used to process it and returns a logical value
*     indicating if the data can be processed by the algorithm without loss
*     of precision.

*  Parameters:
*     dtype
*        An integer identifying the numeric type of the data to be
*        processed. One of the symbolic integers NDF__TYPx (where x is UB,
*        B, UW, W, I, K, R or D) should be used. These values are defined
*        in the "ndf1.h" include file.
*     itype
*        A similar symbolic integer identifying the data type which the
*        algorithm is designed to process.
*     *ok
*        The value non-zero is returned if there will be no loss of
*        precision in converting the data type identified by "dtype" into
*        that identified by "itype" and then processing the data.
*        Otherwise, the value zero is returned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The implementation of this function depends on the collating
*     sequence of data types established by the symbolic constants used to
*     identify them.
