void ndf1Nfind( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, const char *mode,

*  Name:
*     ndf1Nfind

*  Purpose:
*     Find an NDF and import it into the NDF_ system.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Nfind( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, const char *mode,
*                     NdfACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function finds an NDF within an HDS structure or container file,
*     imports it into the NDF_ system and returns the index of the ACB
*     entry allocated to it. The object name supplied may include an NDF
*     section specification, in which case an NDF section entry in the ACB
*     will be returned. Otherwise a base NDF entry will be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the structure containing the NDF.
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        structure component (i.e. the NDF).
*     mode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mode of access
*        required: "READ", "UPDATE" or "WRITE" (this is only used if "loc"
*        is set to NULL, otherwise the mode of access is derived from
*        the input locator).
*     *acb
*        Pointer to the new NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value given for the "name" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an NDF can be
*     found in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of the structure
*     identified by the locator "loc".  Array subscripts may also be used
*     in this component name.  Thus a string such as
*     "MYSTRUC.ZONE(2).IMAGE" could be used as a valid "name" value.
*     -  An NDF can be accessed within an explicitly named container file
*     by supplying the symbolic value NULL for the "loc" parameter,
*     and specifying the container file within the value supplied for the
*     "name" parameter.
*     -  If a blank value is given for the "name" parameter, then the NDF
*     to be imported will be the object identified directly by the locator
*     "loc".
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of zero
*     will be returned for the "acb" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur.  The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
