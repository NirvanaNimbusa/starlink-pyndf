void ndfHpurg_( int indf, int irec1, int irec2, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfHpurg

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a range of records from an NDF history component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHpurg( int indf, int irec1, int irec2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function deletes a specified range of records from an NDF
*     history component. The remaining records are re-numbered starting
*     from 1.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     irec1
*        Number of the first history record to be deleted.
*     irec2
*        Number of the last history record to be deleted.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is provided primarily to allow a lengthy NDF history
*     to be truncated in order to save space. To avoid deceiving subsequent
*     readers, it is normally advisable not to delete arbitrary sections of
*     an NDF's history, but to delete only the earliest part (by setting
*     "irec1" to 1).
*     -  The "irec1" and "irec2" arguments must both identify valid history
*     records which are actually present. Their values may be interchanged
*     without affecting the behaviour of this function.
