void ndf1Dlfor( const char *file, NdfFCB *fcb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Dlfor

*  Purpose:
*     Delete a foreign format file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Dlfor( const char *file, NdfFCB *fcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function deletes a foreign format file associated with an NDF.
*     If required, it first attempts to translate the environment variable
*     NDF_DEL_xxx (where xxx is the foreign format name) to see if this
*     contains an external deletion command. If so, it substitutes the
*     appropriate fields of the file name into this command and then has it
*     executed so as to delete the file. Otherwise, if no external deletion
*     command is defined (or if one is not requested), then the file is
*     deleted directly.

*  Parameters:
*     file
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        foreign format file.
*     fcb
*        Pointer to an object describing the foreign file format. If this
*        is non-NULL, then an external deletion command corresponding to
*        this format will be used (if available). If it is set to NULL,
*        then the file will be deleted directly (and its deletion will not
*        be reported as a foreign format conversion operation, even if the
*        TCB parameter SHCVT is set).
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function will attempt to execute even if it is called with
*     "status" set, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
