void ndfMbndn_( const char *option, int n, int ndfs[], int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfMbndn

*  Purpose:
*     Match the pixel-index bounds of a number of NDFs.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfMbndn( const char *option, int n, int ndfs[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function matches the pixel-index bounds of a number of NDFs so
*     that their array components may be compared pixel-for-pixel during
*     subsequent processing. Matching is performed by selecting an
*     appropriate section from each NDF, the method used to define this
*     section being determined by the value given for the "option"
*     parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     option
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the this parameter
*        determines how the section to be selected from each NDF is
*        defined: "PAD" or "TRIM" (see the Notes section for details). Its
*        value may be abbreviated to 3 characters.
*     n
*        Number of NDFs whose pixel-index bounds are to be matched.
*     ndfs
*        Array of identifiers for the NDFs to be matched. The supplied
*        "ndfs" array should have at least "n" elements.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If "option"="PAD" is specified, then the NDF bounds will be
*     matched by "padding"; i.e. each NDF will be extended by selecting the
*     smallest section from it which encompasses all the pixels in all the
*     NDFs. In effect, the pixel-index bounds of the NDFs are "maximised"
*     and the "union" of all "n" sets of pixels is selected. Any new pixels
*     introduced into an NDF will be padded with the "bad" value.  If the
*     NDFs have different numbers of dimensions, then the dimensionality of
*     all the returned sections will match the NDF with the highest
*     dimensionality.
*     -  If "option"="TRIM" is specified, then the NDF bounds will be
*     matched by "trimming"; i.e. each NDF will be restricted in extent by
*     selecting a section from it which encompasses only those pixels which
*     are present in all the NDFs. In effect, the pixel-index bounds of the
*     NDFs are "minimised" and the "intersection" of all "n" sets of pixels
*     is selected. An error will result if the NDFs have no pixels in
*     common. If the NDFs have different numbers of dimensions, then the
*     dimensionality of all the returned sections will match the NDF with
*     the lowest dimensionality.
*     -  Note that the initial NDF identifier values will be annulled by
*     this function and replaced with identifiers describing appropriate
*     new sections from the original NDFs. If access to the original data
*     is still required, then the initial identifiers may be cloned with
*     the function ndfClone before calling this function.
