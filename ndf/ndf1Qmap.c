*  Name:
*     ndf1Qmap

*  Purpose:
*     Map the quality component of an NDF for access.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Qmap( NdfACB *acb, const char *type, const char *mmod,
*                    void **pntr, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function maps the quality component of an NDF for access and
*     returns a pointer to the mapped values.  The NDF is identified by its
*     ACB entry. The mapped ACB entry may subsequently be unmapped by the
*     ndf1Qump function and cannot be re-mapped until this has been done.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's ACB entry.
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the numeric data type
*        required for access to the quality values (case insensitive).
*     mmod
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mapping mode for
*        access (case insensitive).
*     *pntr
*        Returned holding the pointer to the mapped quality values.
*     *status
*        The global status.
