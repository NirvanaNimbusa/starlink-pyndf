void ndfXpt0c_( const char *value, int indf, const char *xname,

*  Name:
*     ndfXpt0c

*  Purpose:
*     Write a scalar string value to a component within a named NDF extension.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXpt0c( const char *value, int indf, const char *xname,
*                    const char *cmpt, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes a scalar string value to a component within a named
*     NDF extension. The extension must already exist, although the component
*     within the extension need not exist and will be created if necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     value
*        Pointer to a null terminated string to be written to the extension
*        component.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        extension.
*     cmpt
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        component within the extension whose value is to be assigned.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value given for the "cmpt" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an object can
*     be accessed in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of an NDF
*     extension. Array subscripts may also be included. Thus a string such
*     as "CALIB.FILTER(3).WAVELENGTH" could be used as a valid "cmpt"
*     value.
*     -  All HDS structures which lie above the specified component within
*     the extension must already exist, otherwise an error will result.
*     -  If the specified extension component does not already exist, then
*     it will be created by this function. If it already exits, but does
*     not have the correct type or shape, then it will be deleted and a new
*     scalar component with the appropriate type will be created in its
*     place.
