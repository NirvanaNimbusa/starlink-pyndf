void ndfNchnk_( int indf, int mxpix, int *nchunk, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfNchnk

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the number of chunks of contiguous pixels in an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfNchnk( int indf, int mxpix, int *nchunk, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function determines the number of "chunks" (i.e. sections) of
*     contiguous pixels that can be obtained from an NDF, subject to the
*     constraint that no chunk should contain more than a specified maximum
*     number of pixels. More specifically, given the maximum number of
*     pixels in a chunk ("mxpix"), this function returns the maximum value
*     which can be supplied for the ICHUNK parameter of the function
*     ndfChunk if a valid NDF identifier for a chunk of contiguous pixels
*     is to be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     mxpix
*        Maximum number of contiguous pixels required in each chunk.
*     *nchunk
*        Returned holding the number of chunks which can be obtained from
*        the NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is provided to calculate an upper bound on the
*     number of chunks for DO-loops which process NDFs by dividing them
*     into separate chunks by means of calls to the function ndfChunk.
*     -  A value of zero will be returned for the "nchunk" parameter if
*     this function is called with "status" set. The same value will also
*     be returned if the function should fail for any reason.
