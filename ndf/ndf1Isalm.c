*  Purpose:
*     Return whether a string is alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_')

*  Synopsis:
*     int ndf1Isalm( const char *string, size_t start, size_t end )

*  Description:
*     Determine whether the given string is composed entirely of

*  Parameters:
*     string
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be

*     start
*        The zero-based index of the first character to consider in "string".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
*     end
*        The zero-based index of the last character to consider in "string".
*        The whole string is used if "start" > "end".
