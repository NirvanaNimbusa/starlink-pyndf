*  Name:
*     ndf1A2p

*  Purpose:
*     Convert axis coordinates into pixel indices and related information.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1A2p( int n, const double ax[], hdsdim lbnd, hdsdim ubnd,
*                   int havcen, int havwid, const double centre[],
*                   const double width[], int *inc, int ipix0[],
*                   double cent0[], double space0[], int inpix[],
*                   int ipix1[], double cent1[], double width1[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function converts a sequence of axis coordinate values for an
*     NDF axis into corresponding pixel index information. Since NDF pixels
*     may be discontiguous, any particular axis value may lie in a single
*     pixel, in several pixels or in no pixels at all. This function
*     returns information about the index of the pixel lying immediately
*     "below" the axis coordinate and about a second neighbouring pixel
*     which is either the pixel in which the coordinate lies, or the one
*     whose centre lies nearest to the coordinate supplied. A flag
*     indicating whether the coordinate lies within this pixel is also
*     returned.

*  Parameters:
*     n
*        Number of axis coordinate values to be converted.
*     ax
*        Array of axis coordinate values. The supplied "ax" array should
*        have at least "n" elements.
*     lbnd
*        Lower pixel index bound of the NDF dimension to which the axis
*        coordinates refer.
*     ubnd
*        Upper pixel index bound of the NDF dimension to which the axis
*        coordinates refer.
*     havcen
*        Whether an array of pixel centre positions is available for the
*        NDF dimension.
*     havwid
*        Whether an array of pixel width values is available for the NDF
*        dimension. This parameter is not used unless "havcen" is non-zero.
*     centre
*        Array of pixel centre positions, which should either increase or
*        decrease monotonically. This parameter is not used unless "havcen"
*        is set to non-zero. The supplied "centre" array should have at
*        least "ubnd - lbnd + 1" elements.
*     width
*        Array of non-negative pixel width values. This parameter is not
*        used unless both "havcen" and "havwid" are set to non-zero. The
*        supplied "width" array should have at least "ubnd - lbnd + 1"
*        elements.
*     *inc
*        A value of non-zero is returned if the axis centre values (or the
*        defaults used in their place) increase monotonically with pixel
*        index and zero is returned if they decrease monotonically. An
*        error will be reported, and "status" set, if a non-monotonic set
*        of centre values is detected.
*     ipix0
*        Returned holding the returns the index of the NDF pixel "below"
*        the corresponding axis coordinate. If "inc" is non-zero, this will
*        be the index of the pixel with the largest centre position less
*        than or equal to the axis coordinate. If "inc" is zero, it will be
*        the index of the pixel with the smallest centre position greater
*        than or equal to the axis coordinate. The supplied "ipix0" array
*        should have at least "n" elements.
*     cent0
*        Returned holding the returns the centre coordinate of the pixel
*        with index "ipix0". The supplied "cent0" array should have at
*        least "n" elements.
*     space0
*        Returned holding the returns the signed difference between the
*        centre coordinate of the pixel with index "ipix0" + 1 and the
*        centre position of the pixel with index "ipix0". The supplied
*        "space0" array should have at least "n" elements.
*     inpix
*        Returned holding the returns non-zero if the axis coordinate lies
*        within the bounds of a pixel and zero if it does not. The supplied
*        "inpix" array should have at least "n" elements.
*     ipix1
*        Returned holding the if "inpix" is non-zero, then "ipix1" returns
*        the index of the pixel which contains the axis coordinate. If the
*        axis coordinate lies inside more than one pixel, then this index
*        identifies which of these pixels has its centre position nearest
*        to the axis coordinate.  If "inpix" is zero, then "ipix1" returns
*        the index of the pixel whose centre coordinate is nearest to the
*        axis coordinate. The supplied "ipix1" array should have at least
*        "n" elements.
*     cent1
*        Returned holding the returns the value of the centre coordinate
*        for the pixel with index "ipix1". The supplied "cent1" array
*        should have at least "n" elements.
*     width1
*        Returned holding the returns a non-negative value for the width of
*        the pixel with index "ipix1". The supplied "width1" array should
*        have at least "n" elements.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function performs simple checks on the validity of the values
*     it returns.
