*  Name:
*     ndf1Cmpfl

*  Purpose:
*     Compare two file names for equality.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Cmpfl( const char *name1, size_t start1, size_t end1,
*                     const char *name2, int *same, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function compares two file names (or file name fields) for
*     equality, taking account of whether the host file system uses case
*     sensitive file names.

*  Parameters:
*     name1
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the first file name
*        (or file name field) to be compared.
*     start1
*        The zero-based index of the first character to consider in "name1".
*        The whole string is used if "start1" > "end1".
*     end1
*        The zero-based index of the last character to consider in "name1".
*        The whole string is used if "start1" > "end1".
*     name2
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the second file name
*        (or file name field) to be compared.
*     *same
*        Returned holding the whether the two file names are the same.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This function does not perform any file name expansion and does not
*     compare the files themselves. For instance, it is possible for two
*     file names to be judged unequal by this function, but for them to
*     refer to the same file.
