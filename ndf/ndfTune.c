void ndfTune_( int value, const char *tpar, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfTune

*  Purpose:
*     Set an NDF_ system tuning parameter.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfTune( int value, const char *tpar, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets a new value for an NDF_ system internal tuning
*     parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     value
*        New value for the tuning parameter.
*     tpar
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        parameter to be set (case insensitive).  This name may be
*        abbreviated, to no less than 3 characters.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The following tuning parameters are currently available:
*     - "AUTO_HISTORY": Controls whether to include an empty History
*     component in NDFs created using ndfNew or ndfCreat. If the tuning
*     parameter is zet to zero (the default), no History component will be
*     included in the new NDFs. If the tuning parameter is zet non-zero, a
*     History component will be added automatically to the new NDFs.
*     - "DOCVT": Controls whether to convert foreign format data files to
*     and from native NDF format for access (using the facilities described
*     in SSN/20). If DOCVT is set to 1 (the default), and the other
*     necessary steps described in SSN/20 have been taken, then such
*     conversions will be performed whenever they are necessary to gain
*     access to data stored in a foreign format. If DOCVT is set to 0, no
*     such conversions will be attempted and all data will be accessed in
*     native NDF format only. The value of DOCVT may be changed at any
*     time. It is the value current when a dataset is first accessed by the
*     NDF_ library which is significant.
*     -  "KEEP": Controls whether to retain a native format NDF copy of any
*     foreign format data files which are accessed by the NDF_ library (and
*     automatically converted using the facilities described in SSN/20). If
*     KEEP is set to 0 (the default), then the results of converting
*     foreign format data files will be stored in scratch filespace and
*     deleted when no longer required. If KEEP is set to 1, the results of
*     the conversion will instead be stored in permanent NDF data files in
*     the default directory (such files will have the same name as the
*     foreign file from which they are derived and a file type of ".sdf").
*     Setting KEEP to 1 may be useful if the same datasets are to be re-
*     used, as it avoids having to convert them on each occasion. The value
*     of KEEP may be changed at any time. It is the value current when a
*     foreign format file is first accessed by the NDF_ library which is
*     significant.
*     -  "SECMAX": Gives the largest size of an NDF section, in units of
*     maga-pixels. An error is reported if a section is requested that
*     contains more than this number of pixels. The purpose of this
*     parameter is to help guard against accidental use of incorrect units
*     within NDF sections specified by the user. The default value is 1E10.
*     -  "SHCVT": Controls whether diagnostic information is displayed to
*     show the actions being taken to convert to and from foreign data
*     formats (using the facilities described in SSN/20). If SHCVT is set
*     to 1, then this information is displayed to assist in debugging
*     external format conversion software whenever a foreign format file is
*     accessed. If SHCVT is set to 0 (the default), this information does
*     not appear and format conversion proceeds silently unless an error
*     occurs.
*     -  "TRACE": Controls the reporting of additional error messages which
*     may occasionally be useful for diagnosing internal problems within
*     the NDF_ library. If TRACE is set to 1, then any error occurring
*     within the NDF_ system will be accompanied by error messages
*     indicating which internal functions have exited prematurely as a
*     result. If TRACE is set to 0 (the default), this internal diagnostic
*     information will not appear and only standard error messages will be
*     produced.
*     -  "WARN": Controls the issuing of warning messages when certain non-
*     fatal errors in the structure of NDF data objects are detected. If
*     WARN is set to 1 (the default), then a warning message is issued. If
*     WARN is set to 0, then no message is issued.  In both cases normal
*     execution continues and no "status" value is set.
*     -  "PXT...": Controls whether a named NDF extension should be
*     propagated by default when ndfProp or ndfScopy is called. The name of
*     the extension should be appended to the string "PXT" to form the
*     complete tuning parameter name. Thus the tuning parameter PXTFITS
*     would control whether the FITS extension is propagated by default. If
*     the value for the parameter is non-zero, then the extension will be
*     propagated by default. If the value for the parameter is zero, then
*     the extension will not be propagated by default. The default
*     established by this tuning parameter can be over-ridden by specifying
*     the extension explicitly within the CLIST parameter when calling
*     ndfProp or ndfScopy. The default value for all "PXT..." tuning
*     parameters is 1, meaning that all extensions are propagated by
*     default.
*     - 'FIXDT': If FIXDT is set to 1, the date and time string stored
*     in any new History records will be fixed at an arbitrary value
*     ("10-AUG-2018 11:00:00") regardless of the current time. If 0, the
*     real date and time will be used. This facility is intended to allow
*     regression testing, where any change in the date/time within history
*     records could cause a test to fail.
*     - 'FIXSW': If FIXSW is set to 1, the path section of the software
*     field stored in any new History records will be fixed at a blank
*     string regardless of the current time. If 0, the real path will be
*     retained. This facility is intended to allow regression testing,
*     where any change in the software path within history records could
*     cause a test to fail.
