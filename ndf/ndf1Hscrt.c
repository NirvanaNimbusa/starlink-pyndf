*  Name:
*     ndf1Hscrt

*  Purpose:
*     Mark an HDS container file as a scratch file.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hscrt( HDSLoc *loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function marks an HDS container file for deletion (by HDS), thus
*     effectively turning it into a scratch file, which will be deleted
*     when the last primary locator associated with it is annulled (or when
*     HDS terminates if this occurs earlier).

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator to an object in the container file.
*     *status
*        The global status.
