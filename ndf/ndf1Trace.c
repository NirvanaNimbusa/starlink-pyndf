void ndf1Trace( const char *routin, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Trace

*  Purpose:
*     Provide error traceback reporting for the NDF_ library.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Trace( const char *routin, int *status )

*  Description:
*     If error tracing is enabled, then when this function is called with a
*     bad "status" value it will report an error message containing the
*     name of the function which called it. It is intended to be used at
*     the end of each function in the NDF_ library.  A traceback of the
*     function calling sequence is then obtained when a bad "status" value
*     is set in response to an error condition, as a result of each
*     function exiting in sequence.

*  Parameters:
*     routin
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        calling function.
*     *status
*        The global status. The function does not report an error if this
*        is set to SAI__OK or if error tracing is disabled.

*  Notes:
*     -  Error tracing can be enabled or disabled by means of calls to
*     ndfTune (or ndfTrace, which is now obsolete).
*     -  This function is intended to be called from Fortran. No equivalent
*     error tracing facility is currently available for those NDF_
*     functions which are written in C.
