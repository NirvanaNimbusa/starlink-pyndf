*  Name:
*     ndfXnumb

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the number of extensions in an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXnumb( int indf, int *nextn, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the number of extensions present in the NDF
*     whose identifier is supplied.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *nextn
*        Returned holding the number of extensions present.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of zero
*     will be returned for the "nextn" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
