*  Name:
*     ndfReset

*  Purpose:
*     Reset an NDF component to an undefined state.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfReset( int indf, const char *comp, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function resets a component of an NDF so that its value becomes
*     undefined. It may be used to remove unwanted optional NDF components.
*     Its use is also advisable before making format changes to an NDF if
*     retention of the existing values is not required (e.g. before
*     changing the data type of an array component with the ndfStype
*     function); this will avoid the cost of converting the existing
*     values.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        component to be reset; any NDF component name is valid. No error
*        will result if the component is already undefined.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of component names may also be supplied in
*     which case each component will be reset in turn.
*     -  Specifying a component name of "*" will cause all components,
*     except for HISTORY and extensions, to be reset. The former may be
*     reset by specifying its name explicitly, while all extensions may be
*     removed by specifying a component name of "EXTENSION".
*     -  Individual extensions may be removed from an NDF with the ndfXdel
*     function.
*     -  This function may only be used to reset components of a base NDF.
*     If an NDF section is supplied, then it will return without action. No
*     error will result.
*     -  An array component of an NDF cannot be reset while it is mapped
*     for access. Neither can an NDF's axis component be reset while any
*     axis array is mapped for access. This function will fail if either of
*     these conditions occurs.
