*  Name:
*     ndf1Map

*  Purpose:
*     Map an array component of an NDF specified by its ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Map( NdfACB *acb, const char *comp, const char *type,
*                   int cmplx, const char *mmod, void *rpntr[],
*                   void *ipntr[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function obtains mapped access to an array component of an NDF
*     specified by its ACB entry. A comma-separated list of component names
*     may also be supplied, in which case an array of pointers to the
*     components is returned (in the order specified by the list).

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the array component
*        name(s); "DATA", "QUALITY" or "VARIANCE" (or "ERROR") (case
*        insensitive).
*     type
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the numeric data type
*        to be used to access the data; an HDS primitive numeric data type
*        string (case insensitive).
*     cmplx
*        Whether access to complex data is required.
*     mmod
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mapping mode to be
*        used to access the data (case insensitive).
*     rpntr
*        Returned holding the pointer(s) to the mapped non-imaginary array
*        component(s).
*     ipntr
*        Returned holding the pointer(s) to the mapped imaginary array
*        component(s) (not used if "cmplx" is zero).
*     *status
*        The global status.
