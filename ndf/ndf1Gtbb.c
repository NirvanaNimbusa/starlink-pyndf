*  Name:
*     ndf1Gtbb

*  Purpose:
*     Get the effective bad-bits mask value for an ACB entry.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Gtbb( NdfACB *acb, unsigned char *badbit, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the effective bad-bits mask value to be applied
*     to the quality component of an ACB entry. It takes account of any
*     override value which may have been applied.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *badbit
*        Returned holding the unsigned byte bad-bits value.
*     *status
*        The global status.
