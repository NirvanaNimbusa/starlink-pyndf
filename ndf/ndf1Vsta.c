*  Name:
*     ndf1Vsta

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the state of the variance component of an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Vsta( NdfACB *acb, int *state, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a logical value indicating if the variance
*     component of an NDF is defined. The NDF is identified by its ACB
*     entry.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's ACB entry.
*     *state
*        Returned holding the whether the variance component's values are
*        defined (non-zero for defined, zero for undefined).
*     *status
*        The global status.
