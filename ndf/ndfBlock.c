*  Name:
*     ndfBlock

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain an NDF section containing a block of adjacent pixels.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfBlock( int indf1, int ndim, const hdsdim mxdim[], int iblock,
*                    int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns an identifier for an NDF section describing a
*     "block" of adjacent pixels selected from an initial NDF. The function
*     divides the original NDF logically into a series of such blocks, each
*     of which does not exceed a specified maximum number of pixels in each
*     dimension. The function's "iblock" parameter allows one of these
*     blocks to be selected; an NDF section for it is then returned.

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        Identifier for the initial NDF.
*     ndim
*        Number of maximum dimension sizes.
*     mxdim
*        Array specifying the maximum size of a block in pixels along each
*        dimension.
*     iblock
*        Number of the block required (the first block is numbered 1).
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the identifier for an NDF section describing the
*        block.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is intended to allow NDFs to be processed in smaller
*     pieces by selecting successive blocks, each of which may then be
*     processed individually. Note that in general not all the blocks
*     selected from an NDF will have the same shape or size, although none
*     will exceed the specified maximum number of pixels in each dimension.
*     -  Corresponding blocks selected from different NDFs (or NDF
*     sections) with identical shapes will themselves have identical shapes
*     and will contain the same number of pixels.
*     -  All NDF sections obtained via this function have the same number
*     of dimensions as the input NDF. If the number of maximum dimension
*     sizes supplied ("ndim") is less than this number, then a value of 1
*     will be used for the extra dimension sizes. If the value of "ndim" is
*     larger than this number, then the excess dimension sizes will be
*     ignored.
*     -  If the number of the requested block ("iblock") exceeds the number
*     of blocks available in the NDF, then a value of NDF__NOID will be
*     returned for the "indf2" parameter (but no error will result). This
*     condition may be used to terminate a loop when all available blocks
*     have been processed. The ndfNbloc function may also be used to
*     determine the number of blocks available.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason.
*     -  The NDF__NOID constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
