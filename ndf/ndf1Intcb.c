*  Name:
*     ndf1Intcb

*  Purpose:
*     Initialise the NDF_ system Tuning Control Block.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Intcb( int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function initialises values in the NDF_ system Tuning Control
*     Block (TCB) which affect the behaviour of the system as a whole. It
*     should be invoked before any of the values in the TCB are used.

*  Parameters:
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     This function will only execute once. If it is invoked again after a
*     previous successful invocation, it will return without further
*     action.
