*  Name:
*     NDF_PAR

*  Purpose:
*     Define public global constants for the NDF_ system.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global constants include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global constants which are used
*     by the NDF_ system and which may also be needed by software which
*     calls routines from this system.

*  History:
*     4-DEC-1990 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     11-MAY-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__SZHIS constant.
*     14-MAY-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__SZHMX constant.
*     19-MAY-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__SZHDT and NDF__SZHUM constants.
*     3-JUN-1993 (RFWS):
*        Transferred the NDF__SZAPP constant to make it public.
*     1-OCT-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__SZHST and NDF__SZUSR constants.
*     26-APR-1994 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__SZREF constant.
*     2-OCT-1998 (RFWS):
*        Added the NDF__F77 and NDF__C constants.
*     18-JUL-2000 (DSB):
*        Increased NDF__SZHMX from 200 to 300 to keep it in step with
*        MSG__SZMSG.

*  Global Constants:

*  General.
*  =======

*  Maximum number of NDF dimensions.
      INTEGER NDF__MXDIM
      PARAMETER ( NDF__MXDIM = 7 )

*  Value which is never used as an NDF identifier, to which an invalid
*  identifier may be set.
      INTEGER NDF__NOID
      PARAMETER ( NDF__NOID = 0 )

*  Value which is never used as an NDF placeholder, to which an invalid
*  placeholder may be set.
      INTEGER NDF__NOPL
      PARAMETER ( NDF__NOPL = 0 )

*  String lengths.
*  ==============

*  Maximum size of a string describing an NDF access type, e.g.
*  'DELETE'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZACC
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZACC = 6 )

*  Recommended maximum length of the name of the currently-executing
*  application.
      INTEGER NDF__SZAPP
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZAPP = 80 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the storage form of an NDF
*  array component, e.g. 'SIMPLE'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZFRM
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZFRM = 10 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the full data type of an NDF
*  array component (including whether it is complex), e.g.
*  'COMPLEX_REAL'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZFTP
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZFTP = 15 )

*  Maximum length of a history component date/time string.
      INTEGER NDF__SZHDT
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZHDT = 24 )

*  Recommended length of a line of history text.
      INTEGER NDF__SZHIS
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZHIS = 72 )

*  Maximum length of a line of history text (this limit is determined
*  primarily by the use of MSG_ routines for expanding message tokens,
*  so is set equal to MSG__SZMSG).
      INTEGER NDF__SZHMX
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZHMX = 300 )

*  Recommended maximum length of the host machine node name recorded in
*  NDF history records.
      INTEGER NDF__SZHST
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZHST = 80 )

*  Maximum length of a history update mode string, e.g. 'DISABLED'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZHUM
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZHUM = 8 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the "mapping mode" used to map
*  an NDF array component for access, e.g. 'WRITE/ZERO'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZMMD
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZMMD = 11 )

*  Recommended length of a character variable that is to hold the full
*  "reference name" of an NDF dataset.
      INTEGER NDF__SZREF
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZREF = 512 )

*  Maximum length of a string describing the numeric type of an NDF
*  array component, e.g. '_INTEGER'.
      INTEGER NDF__SZTYP
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZTYP = 8 )

*  Recommended maximum length of the user name recorded in NDF history
*  records.
      INTEGER NDF__SZUSR
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZUSR = 80 )

*  Maximum length of a string containing an NDF extension name.
      INTEGER NDF__SZXNM
      PARAMETER ( NDF__SZXNM = 15 )
