void ndfShift_( int nshift, const hdsdim shift[], int indf, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndfShift

*  Purpose:
*     Apply pixel-index shifts to an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfShift( int nshift, const hdsdim shift[], int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function applies pixel-index shifts to an NDF. An integer shift
*     is applied to each dimension so that its pixel-index bounds, and the
*     indices of each pixel, change by the amount of shift applied to the
*     corresponding dimension. The NDF's pixels retain their values and
*     none are lost.

*  Parameters:
*     nshift
*        Number of dimensions to which shifts are to be applied. This must
*        not exceed the number of NDF dimensions. If fewer shifts are
*        applied than there are NDF dimensions, then the extra dimensions
*        will not be shifted.
*     shift
*        The pixel-index shifts to be applied to each dimension.
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  Pixel-index shifts applied to a base NDF will affect the
*     appearance of that NDF as seen by all base-NDF identifiers associated
*     with it. However, NDF sections derived from that base NDF will remain
*     unchanged (as regards both pixel-indices and array values).
*     -  Pixel-index shifts applied to an NDF section only affect that
*     section itself, and have no effect on other NDF identifiers.
*     -  Pixel-index shifts cannot be applied to a base NDF while any of
*     its components (or any of its axis arrays) is mapped for access, even
*     through another identifier.
*     -  Pixel-index shifts cannot be applied to an NDF section while any
*     of its components (or any of its axis arrays) is mapped for access
*     through the identifier supplied to this function.
