*  Name:
*     ndf1Hfwrt

*  Purpose:
*     Format text and write it to a history record.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hfwrt( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *appn, int nlines,
*                     const char *text[], int trans, int wrap, int rjust,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes a series of text lines to the current history
*     record, after first applying optional message token translation and
*     formatting operations.  If the history has not yet been modified by
*     the current application (and "appn" is not "<"append">"), it creates
*     a new history record, initialises it, and inserts the text suppled.
*     If the history has already been modified (or if "appn" is
*     "<"append">"), then the new text is simply appended to any already
*     present. The function returns without action if the NDF does not have
*     a history component.

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the NDF whose history is to be modified.
*     appn
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        application. This is only used (to initialise the new history
*        record) if the history has not yet been modified by the current
*        application, otherwise it is ignored. If a blank value is given,
*        then a suitable default will be used instead. The special value
*        "<"append">" may be supplied in order to append the text lines to
*        the current history text even if the  history has not yet been
*        modified by the current application.
*     nlines
*        Number of new lines of text to be added to the history record.
*     text
*        Pointer to an array with at least "nlines" elements, each being
*        a pointer to a null terminated string holding a line text.
*     trans
*        Whether message tokens embedded in the input text lines are to be
*        translated. If not, then all input text will be interpreted
*        literally.
*     wrap
*        Whether "wrapping" of paragraphs in the input text is to be
*        performed to adjust the text width to that of the history record
*        being written. If specified, wrapping takes place after message
*        token expansion.
*     rjust
*        Whether to pad lines of text so as to right justify them within
*        the width of the history record being written. If not, then the
*        right margin is left ragged.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If a new history record is being initialised, then the text length
*     (characters per line) of the new record is determined by the length
*     of the longest element of the "text" array. If the history record has
*     already been written to, then the existing line text length is not
*     altered and formatting of new text takes place so as to fit the
*     existing text length.

*  History:
*     3-APR-2019 (DSB):
*        Original version, based on equivalent Fortran function by RFWS.
*     11-OCT-2019 (DSB):
*        Correct inappropriate use of of MXOUT when specifying the length
*        of the spaced-padded fixed-length strings passed to ndf1Hout. The
*        length should be "l", not "MXOUT". This caused badly formatted
*        history text.
*     22-OCT-2019 (DSB):
*        Previously, the "textlen" variable was incremented to allow for
*        a space following the longest line of text. But this caused an
*        error to be reported for cases where the longest line of text was
*        exactly equal to the maximum allowed length (NDF__SZHMX), since
*        the incremented length was then bigger than NDF__SZHMX.  This
*        change does away with the increment to "textlen" to avoid this
*        problem, and also because the increment should not be needed anyway.
