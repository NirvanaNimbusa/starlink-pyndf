void ndfNbloc_( int indf, int ndim, const hdsdim mxdim[], int *nblock, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfNbloc

*  Purpose:
*     Determine the number of blocks of adjacent pixels in an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfNbloc( int indf, int ndim, const hdsdim mxdim[], int *nblock,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function determines the number of "blocks" (i.e. sections) of
*     adjacent pixels that can be obtained from an NDF, subject to the
*     constraint that no block should exceed a specified maximum number of
*     pixels in any dimension. More specifically, given the maximum size in
*     pixels of a block in each dimension ("mxdim"), this function returns
*     the maximum value which can be supplied for the IBLOCK parameter of
*     the function ndfBlock if a valid NDF identifier for a block of
*     adjacent pixels is to be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     ndim
*        Number of maximum dimension sizes.
*     mxdim
*        Array specifying the maximum size of a block in pixels along each
*        dimension.
*     *nblock
*        Returned holding the number of blocks which can be obtained from
*        the NDF.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function is provided to calculate an upper bound on the
*     number of blocks for DO-loops which process NDFs by dividing them
*     into separate blocks by means of calls to the function ndfBlock.
*     -  If the number of maximum dimension sizes supplied ("ndim") is less
*     than the number of NDF dimensions, then a value of 1 will be used for
*     the extra dimension sizes. If the value of "ndim" is larger than this
*     number, then the excess dimension sizes will be ignored.
*     -  A value of zero will be returned for the "nblock" parameter if
*     this function is called with "status" set. The same value will also
*     be returned if the function should fail for any reason.
