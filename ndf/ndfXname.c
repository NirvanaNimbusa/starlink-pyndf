void ndfXname_( int indf, int n, char *xname, size_t xname_length, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfXname

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the name of the N"th extension in an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXname( int indf, int n, char *xname, size_t xname_length,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the name of the N"th extension in an NDF. If
*     the requested extension does not exist, then the name is returned
*     blank. The function may therefore be used to obtain the names of all
*     the extensions present by setting "n" to 1,2... etc.  until a blank
*     name is returned. Note that the order in which these names are
*     obtained is not defined.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     n
*        The number of the extension whose name is required.
*     xname
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the extension name (in upper case).
*     xname_length
*        The length of the supplied 'xname' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__SZXNM is provided to define the length
*     of character variables which are to hold an NDF extension name. This
*     constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
