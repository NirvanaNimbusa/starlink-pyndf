/*

*  Name:
*     ndf1Expid

*  Purpose:
*     Export an NDF identifier or placeholder.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ndf1Expid( NdfObject *object, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function converts a pointer to an ACB or PCB into an integer
*     identifier which can be issued to an application to refer to the ACB
*     or PCB. The identifier issued is saved in the ACB or PCB so that a
*     check on its validity can later be made.  Identifiers are encoded so
*     that it is extremely unlikely that two identical ones will ever be
*     issued, even if the NDF_ system is closed down completely and restarted
*     (an identifier which is still valid can, of course, never be duplicated).
*     This makes it possible to detect invalid identifiers and to report
*     problems with "dangling" identifier values if an application neglects
*     to annul them.

*  Parameters:
*     object
*        Pointer to the ACB or PCB.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     The returned integer identifier.

*  Notes:
*     -  If an error has already occurred, or if this function should
*     fail for any reason, NDF__NOID or NDF__NOPL will be returned.
