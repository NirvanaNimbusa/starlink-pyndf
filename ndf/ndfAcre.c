*  Name:
*     ndfAcre

*  Purpose:
*     Ensure that an axis coordinate system exists for an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfAcre( int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function ensures that an axis coordinate system exists for an
*     NDF. An axis component with default coordinate values is created if
*     necessary.

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.
