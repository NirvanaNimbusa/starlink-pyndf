*  Name:
*     ndf1Substr

*  Purpose:
*     Create a copy of a substring.

*  Synopsis:
*     char *ndf1Substr( const char *text, size_t start, size_t end,
*                       int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer
*     containing a copy of a substring of the specified string.

*  Parameters:
*     text
*        Pointer to the null terminated string to be copied.
*     start
*        Zero based index of the first character to be copied. The start
*        of the string is used if a negative value is supplied.
*     send
*        Zero based index of the last character to be copied. The end of
*        the string is used if the supplied value is bigger than the
*        length of the string.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer holding the required
*     substring. It should be freed using astFree when no longer needed.

*  Notes:
*     - NULL is returned if an error occurs, or if "text" is NULL.
*     - The whole string is copied if "start" is greater than "end".
