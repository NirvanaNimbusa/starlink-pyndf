*  Name:
*     ndf1Chacc

*  Purpose:
*     Check that a specified type of access to an ACB entry is permitted.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Chacc( NdfACB *acb, const char *access, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function checks that the specified type of access to an ACB
*     entry is permitted. If it is, then it returns without further action,
*     otherwise an error is reported.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the ACB entry.
*     access
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the type of access
*        required (case insensitive).
*     *status
*        The global status.
