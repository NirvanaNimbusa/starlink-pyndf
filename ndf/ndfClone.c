*  Name:
*     ndfClone

*  Purpose:
*     Clone an NDF identifier.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfClone( int indf1, int *indf2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function produces a "cloned" copy of an NDF identifier (i.e. it
*     produces a new identifier describing an NDF with identical attributes
*     to the original).

*  Parameters:
*     indf1
*        NDF identifier to be cloned.
*     *indf2
*        Returned holding the cloned identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of
*     NDF__NOID will be returned for the "indf2" parameter, although no
*     further processing will occur. The same value will also be returned
*     if the function should fail for any reason. The NDF__NOID constant is
*     defined in the header file "ndf.h".
