*  Name:
*     ndfForm

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the storage form of an NDF array component.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfForm( int indf, const char *comp, char *form,
*                   size_t form_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the storage form of an NDF array component as
*     an upper case character string (e.g. "SIMPLE").

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the NDF
*        array component whose storage form is required: "DATA", "QUALITY"
*        or "VARIANCE".
*     form
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the storage form of the component.
*     form_length
*        The length of the supplied 'form' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__SZFRM may be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable to hold the storage form of an NDF
*     array component. This constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
*     -  At present, the NDF_ functions only support "primitive", "simple",
*     "delta" and "scaled" arrays, so only the values "PRIMITIVE",
*     "SIMPLE", "DELTA" and "SCALED" can be returned.
