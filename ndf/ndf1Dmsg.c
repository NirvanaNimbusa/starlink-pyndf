void ndf1Dmsg( const char *token, NdfDCB *dcb ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Dmsg

*  Purpose:
*     Assign the name of an NDF stored in the DCB to a message token.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Dmsg( const char *token, NdfDCB *dcb )

*  Description:
*     This function assigns the full name (including the file name) of an
*     NDF data object to a message token for use with the ERR_ and MSG_
*     functions (SUN/104). The NDF is identified by the index of its entry
*     in the DCB.

*  Parameters:
*     token
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        message token.
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the NDF data object entry in the DCB.

*  Notes:
*     This function has no "status" parameter and does not perform normal
*     error checking. If it should fail, then no value will be assigned to
*     the message token and this will be apparent in the final message.
