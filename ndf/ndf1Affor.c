void ndf1Affor( NdfFCB *fcb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Affor

*  Purpose:
*     Perform post-processing on a dataset.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Affor( NdfFCB *fcb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function obtains a post-processing command to apply to a dataset
*     after it has been released, by translating the appropriate
*     environment variable. It then substitutes the necessary message token
*     values into this command and has it executed so as to perform the
*     required post-processing.

*  Parameters:
*     fcb
*        Pointer to an object describing the format of the dataset (may be
*        NULL to indicate a native format NDF dataset).
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function does not have access to data in the DCB describing
*     the dataset being processed. This is because the dataset will already
*     have been released by the time this function is executed. Instead,
*     the name of the dataset (and any related items) should be supplied
*     via message tokens which have been defined earlier.
*     -  All message tokens in the current context will be left in an
*     undefined state after this function exits.
*     -  This function does not make any checks on the existence or
*     accessibility of any file or dataset before attempting to process it.
