void ndf1Hwdef( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *appn, int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     ndf1Hwdef

*  Purpose:
*     Write default history information to an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hwdef( NdfDCB *dcb, const char *appn, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes default history information to the current
*     history record of an NDF, creating a new record if necessary. It
*     returns without action if (a) the NDF does not have a history
*     component, (b) it has been accessed read-only, (c) default history
*     information has already been written to the current history record
*     or, (d) the history update mode is "DISABLED".

*  Parameters:
*     dcb
*        Pointer to the data object whose history is to be updated.
*     appn
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        currently-executing application. This is used if a new history
*        record has to be created by this function, otherwise it is
*        ignored. If a blank value is given, then a suitable default will
*        be used instead.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If this function has to create a new history record, then the text
*     width used for this record will be equal to NDF__SZHIS. If it is
*     appending information to a pre-existing current history record, then
*     the new text will be formatted to the pre-existing text width.

*     26-APR-2019 (DSB):
*        If tuning parameter FIXSW is defined, remove the path from the
*        software file name. This is to make it easier to compare NDFs
*        compared using different versions of the software.
