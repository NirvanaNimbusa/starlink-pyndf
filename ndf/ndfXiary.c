*  Name:
*     ndfXiary

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain access to an array stored in an NDF extension.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfXiary( int indf, const char *xname, const char *cmpt,
*                    const char *mode, Ary **ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function locates an array stored in an NDF extension and imports
*     it into the ARY_ system, returning an array identifier for it. If
*     necessary, a section of the array will be selected so that it matches
*     pixel-for-pixel with the main data array of the NDF (or NDF section)
*     supplied.  The returned array identifier may be used to manipulate
*     the array using the ARY_ functions (see SUN/11).

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     xname
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        extension.
*     cmpt
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the array
*        component within the extension.
*     mode
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the mode of access
*        required: "READ", "UPDATE" or "WRITE".
*     *ary
*        Returned holding the array identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value given for the "cmpt" parameter may be an HDS path name,
*     consisting of several fields separated by ".", so that an object can
*     be accessed in a sub-component (or a sub-sub-component...) of an NDF
*     extension. Array subscripts may also be included. Thus a string such
*     as "FILTER(3).FLATFIELD" could be used as a valid "cmpt" value.
*     -  This function will normally generate an array section. However, if
*     the input NDF is a base NDF and the requested array has the same
*     pixel-index bounds, then there is no need to generate a section in
*     order to access the required part of the array. In this case, a base
*     array identifier will be issued instead.
*     -  It is the caller's responsibility to annul the ARY_ system
*     identifier returned by this function (e.g. by calling "aryAnnul")
*     when it is no longer required. The NDF_ system will not perform this
*     task itself.
*     -  The array associated with the returned identifier will have the
*     same number of dimensions as the base array from which it is derived.
*     If the input NDF has fewer dimensions than this, then the pixel-index
*     bounds of the extra array dimensions are preserved unchanged. If the
*     NDF has more dimensions, then the extra ones are ignored.
*     -  This function takes account of the transfer window of the NDF
*     supplied and will restrict the transfer window of the new array
*     section so as not to grant access to regions of the base array which
*     are not accessible in the input NDF.
*     -  If this function is called with "status" set, then a value of NULL
*     will be returned for the "ary" parameter, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     function should fail for any reason.
*     -  The NULL constant is defined in the header file "ary.h".
