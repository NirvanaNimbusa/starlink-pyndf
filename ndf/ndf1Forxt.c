*  Name:
*     ndf1Forxt

*  Purpose:
*     Locate a foreign format extension specified within a complete
*     structure specification.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Forxt( const char *name, size_t start, size_t end, size_t *x1,
*                     size_t *x2, int *status )

*  Description:
*     Some foreign formats can hold the equivalent of several NDFs within
*     a single data file. An example is the FITS format. FITS files may
*     include image extensions, each of which could give rise to a separate
*     NDF. When a foreign data structure is specified, any syntax required
*     to identify a particular sub-structure within the foreign format file
*     should be specified after the file type (or file name if no file type
*     is given), and before any NDF slice specification. The syntax should
*     be enclosed within matching square brackets.
*
*     This function looks for such syntax within the specified name, and
*     returns the index of the opening and closing square brackets. No
*     checks can be performed on the validity of the syntax since it is
*     format-specific.

*  Parameters:
*     name
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the
*        foreign NDF to be opened. NOTE, this should not include an NDF
*        slice specification.
*     start
*        Zero-based index of the first character to use in "name".
*     end
*        Zero-based index of the last character to use in "name".
*     *x1
*        Returned holding the index of the opening square bracket within
*        "name", or one more than the used length of the string if the name
*        does not include a foreign extension specifier.
*     *x2
*        Returned holding the index of the closing square bracket within
*        "name", or 0 if the name does not include a foreign extension
*        specifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - If "start" is greater than "end", the whole of "name" is used.
*     - If this function is called with "status" set, then value of 1 and
*     zero will be returned for "x1" and "x2". The same values will also be
*     returned if the function should fail for any reason.
