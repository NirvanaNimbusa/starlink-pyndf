void ndfNoacc_( const char *access, int indf, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfNoacc

*  Purpose:
*     Disable a specified type of access to an NDF.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfNoacc( const char *access, int indf, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function disables the specified type of access to an NDF, so
*     that any subsequent attempt to access it in that way will fail.
*     Access restrictions imposed on an NDF identifier by this function
*     will be propagated to any new identifiers derived from it, and cannot
*     be revoked.

*  Parameters:
*     access
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the type of access to
*        be disabled: "BOUNDS", "DELETE", "MODIFY", "SHIFT", "TYPE" or
*        "WRITE".
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Disabling each type of access imposes the following restrictions on
*     an NDF:
*     -  "BOUNDS" prevents the pixel-index bounds of a base NDF from being
*     altered.
*     -  "DELETE" prevents an NDF from being deleted.
*     -  "MODIFY" prevents any form of modification to the NDF (i.e. it
*     disables all the other access types).
*     -  "SHIFT" prevents pixel-index shifts from being applied to a base
*     NDF.
*     -  "TYPE" prevents the data type of any NDF components from being
*     altered.
*     -  "WRITE" prevents new values from being written to the NDF, or the
*     state of any of its components from being reset.
