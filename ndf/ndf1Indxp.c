*  Name:
*     ndf1Indxp

*  Purpose:
*     Find a character in a string, ignoring characters in parentheses.

*  Synopsis:
*     int ndf1Indxp( const char *str, char ch, size_t *iat )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the position of the first occurrence of the
*     character "ch" in the string "str", omitting any occurrences which
*     lie within parentheses "(...)". Account is taken of nested
*     parentheses.

*  Parameters:
*     str
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be
*        searched.
*     ch
*        Character to be found.
*     *iat
*        On entry, the zero-based index of the first character to be
*        checked. On exit, the index of the matching character, if any.
*        Returned unchanged if no matching character is found.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the character is found, and zero is
*     returned otherwise.
