*  Name:
*     ndfAform

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the storage form of an NDF axis array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfAform( int indf, const char *comp, int iaxis, char *form,
*                    size_t form_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the storage form of a specified NDF axis array
*     component as an upper case character string (e.g. "PRIMITIVE").

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the axis
*        array component whose storage form is required: "CENTRE",
*        "VARIANCE" or "WIDTH".
*     iaxis
*        Number of the NDF axis for which information is required.
*     form
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the storage form of the axis array.
*     form_length
*        The length of the supplied 'form' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__SZFRM may be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable to hold the storage form of an NDF
*     axis array. This constant is defined in the header file "ndf.h".
*     -  At present, the NDF_ functions only support "primitive" and
*     "simple" arrays, so only the values "PRIMITIVE" and "SIMPLE" can be
*     returned.
