*  Name:
*     ndf1Rjust

*  Purpose:
*     Right justify a string.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Rjust( char *string, int string_length )

*  Description:
*     This function right justifies a string by filling out the spaces
*     between words with additional blank space. The right margin is
*     taken as the length of the character variable as supplied in
*     "string_length". Leading blanks are preserved.

*  Parameters:
*     string
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the string to be right
*        justified and returned.
*     string_length
*        The length of the supplied 'string' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
