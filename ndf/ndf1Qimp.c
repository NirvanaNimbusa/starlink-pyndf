void ndf1Qimp( NdfACB *acb, int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndf1Qimp

*  Purpose:
*     Import information about an NDF's quality component into the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Qimp( NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function imports information about an NDF's quality component so
*     that it is available in the ACB. No action is taken if this
*     information is already available. Otherwise, DCB quality information
*     is first acquired. Then, if the quaility array exists, ARY_ system
*     identifiers for relevant sections of it are entered into all the ACB
*     entries which refer to that NDF data object. If the quality array
*     does not exist, then null identifiers (value NULL) are entered
*     instead. The NDF is identified to this function by its ACB entry.

*  Parameters:
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF's ACB entry.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function should normally be used instead of a direct call to
*     ndf1Dq followed by updating of a single ACB entry.  It ensures that
*     all the ACB entries which refer to the quality object are updated
*     simultaneously so that their state reflects that of the actual data
*     object.
