*  Name:
*     ndfAtype

*  Purpose:
*     Obtain the numeric type of an NDF axis array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfAtype( int indf, const char *comp, int iaxis, char *type,
*                    size_t type_length, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the numeric type of an NDF axis array as an
*     upper-case character string (e.g. "_REAL").

*  Parameters:
*     indf
*        NDF identifier.
*     comp
*        Pointer to a null terminated string holding the name of the axis
*        array component whose numeric type is required: "CENTRE",
*        "VARIANCE" or "WIDTH".
*     iaxis
*        Number of the NDF axis for which information is required.
*     type
*        Pointer to an array in which to return a null terminated string
*        holding the numeric type of the axis array.
*     type_length
*        The length of the supplied 'type' array. This should include
*        room for the terminating null.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  A comma-separated list of axis array component names may also be
*     supplied to this function. In this case the result returned will be
*     the lowest precision numeric type to which all the specified axis
*     arrays can be converted without unnecessary loss of information.
*     -  A value of zero may be supplied for the "iaxis" parameter, in
*     which case the function will combine the results for all the NDF"s
*     axes in the same way as described above.
*     -  The symbolic constant NDF__SZTYP may be used for declaring the
*     length of a character variable which is to hold the numeric type of
*     an NDF axis array. This constant is defined in the include file
*     "ndf.h".
