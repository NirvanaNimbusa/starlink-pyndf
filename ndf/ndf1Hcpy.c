*  Name:
*     ndf1Hcpy

*  Purpose:
*     Copy lines of history text.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Hcpy( int nlines, size_t clen, char *hist, const char *text,
*                    int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function copies lines of history text from one character array
*     to another. Each array consists of a contiguous block of fixed
*     length spaced-padded strings without terminating null characters.

*  Parameters:
*     nlines
*        Number of lines of text to copy.
*     clen
*        The length of each spaced-padded fixed-length string in text.
*     hist
*        Pointer to a character array in which to return the output history
*        lines. It has the same format as "text".
*     text
*        Pointer to a character array holding the input text lines to be copied.
*        it's length should be at least "nlines*clen". Each line of text should
*        be space-padded to occupy a length of "clen" characters. Note, there
*        should be no terminating null characters in this array.
*     *status
*        The global status.
