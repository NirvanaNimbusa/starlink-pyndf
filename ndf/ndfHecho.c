void ndfHecho_( int nlines, char *const text[], int *status ){

*  Name:
*     ndfHecho

*  Purpose:
*     Write out lines of history text.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndfHecho( int nlines, char *const text[], int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function writes a series of lines of text to the standard output
*     channel, indented by three spaces. It is provided as a default
*     service function which may be passed as an parameter to ndfHout in
*     order to display NDF history information.
*
*     The specification of this function may be used as a template when
*     writing alternative service functions for use by ndfHout.

*  Parameters:
*     nlines
*        Number of lines of text to be written.
*     text
*        An array containing "nlines" elements, each of which is a
*        pointer to a null-terminated character string holding a line
*        of text.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     Before passing this (or a similar) function as an parameter to
*     ndfHout the calling function should declare it in a Fortran EXTERNAL
*     statement.
