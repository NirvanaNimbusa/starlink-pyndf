*  Name:
*     ndf1Awump

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap an axis width array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ndf1Awump( int iax, NdfACB *acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function unmaps an NDF axis width array which has previously
*     been mapped for access with the ndf1Awmap function. An error will be
*     reported if the specified axis array is not currently mapped for
*     access. The NDF is identified by its index in the ACB.

*  Parameters:
*     iax
*        Zero-based index of the axis whose width array is to be unmapped.
*     acb
*        Pointer to the NDF entry in the ACB.
*     *status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This function will attempt to execute even if "status" is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
