starlink.hds is a Python extension to allow one to open HDS files
inside Python. It builds the HDS libraries itself and does not require
the Starlink software suite to be installed on your system. It also
uses numpy, and requires a c compiler to built.

This was adapted from the starlink.hds packaged shipped inside
starlink-pyndf: https://github.com/timj/starlink-pyndf The primary
difference is that this package does not require a separate Starlink
installation as it directly builds the hds library files, and it does
not include any NDF specific access.


It is installed via.

python setup.py install

or

python setup.py install --prefix=<your specific installation directory>
